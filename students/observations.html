Include resources you used, and a brief summary of the resource.</p> <ol><li>Redux
<ul><li>Redux is a JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management. At the base level, redux makes managing global state easier with easy to understand api and a host of enhancements that work out of the box. I think of it as a wrapper around react context. While it is possible to implement everything redux does without it and using react context, redux exposes more concise api, reducing boilerplate code, as well as enhances its base functionality with features such as middleware to handle side effects of accessing the storage.
Redux is heavily used in the codebase of FreeCodeCamp, centralising state management and the persistent storage solution. Redux actions are used to trigger state changes for almost all interactions in the app.
Therefore, in order to contribute meaningfully to more than just UI updates like I have, Redux was one of the first things I had to learn.</li> <li>Resource used: <a href="https://redux.js.org">Redux official docs</a> <ul><li>Comprehensive official documentation on redux</li> <li>Used in conjunction with study of the implementation on FreeCodeCamp</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li>Playwright
<ul><li>Playwright is an end-to-end testing framework packed full of everything you need to comprehensively test any web app. FreeCodeCamp strongly enforces end-to-end testing, while putting less emphasis on unit testing. In order to contribute more than just UI changes, I had to be able to write tests for new functionality I introduced or bugs I fixed. Thus, I learned not just how to write good tests, but how to set up, run and write tests using Playwright. With the popularity of playwright coupled with the importance of testing, this is a critical skill to have in my career as a software engineer.</li> <li>Resource used: <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/intro">Playwright official docs</a> <ul><li>Comprehensive official documentation on playwright</li> <li>Used in conjunction with examples from the other e2e tests present in FreeCodeCamp</li></ul></li> <li>Resource used: <a href="https://medium.com/@jeremie.fleurant/how-i-managed-to-leave-my-e2e-tests-for-months-and-find-them-all-green-32dd3361c082">Making E2E tests resilient and maintainable</a> <ul><li>One of many articles used in finding out how best to write tests</li> <li>Gives a high level look at how tests should be written such as making tests dynamic and making them as concise and necessary as possible</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li>Contributing to open source
<ul><li>Open source contributions are very daunting at first and it is difficult to know how to even begin.

<ul><li>When you create a PR comprising of edits to a certain part of the codebase. A bot automatically adds relevant labels to that PR such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang">scope: curriculum</code></li> <li>When maintainers review a PR, they use labels to signify its status in the review pipeline
<ul><li><code class="hljs inline no-lang">status: waiting review</code> is added to allow other maintainers to indicate its suitability for another maintainer to review. I.e, all tests pass and the first reviewer approves or is not familliar enough with that part to review the change</li> <li><code class="hljs inline no-lang">status: waiting update</code> is added to indicate a review has been given and it is waiting for the contributor to make the required changes</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li>FreeCodeCamp seems to have a hierarchy of maintainers
<ul><li>When the first reviewer chances upon a fresh PR, it is common for them to just add the appropriate <code class="hljs inline no-lang">status: waiting review</code> label and only leave comments on necessary fixes to failing CI/CD tests</li> <li>Most of the time after all the tests pass on a non-trivial PR, the first reviewer wouldn&#39;t leave an official review, only add the label</li> <li>It is only after a period of time will then another reviewer leave an actual review</li> <li>This seems to imply a hierarchy where less experienced maintainers go over the bulk of PRs and iron out fundamental issues such as failing critical CI/CD so seniors have less to go through.</li></ul></li> <li>FreeCodeCamp uses Crowdin to manage open source translations
<ul><li>Since FreeCodeCamp aims to be accessible to everyone across the globe it needs to have all its resources translated to different languages</li> <li>To facilitate contributors to this effort, it uses Crowdin, a localization management platform which has similar version control and PR functionality as Github</li> <li>Crowdin allows contributors to proofread the proposed translations and vote on them before they are accepted, similar to upvoting and downvoting on Reddit</li> <li>This method of managing open source translations is not something I have encountered before and seems to fit very well with the open source nature of the project</li> <li>This kind of translation handling could be put to use in our NUS open source projects if they eventually require i18n and are big enough to accept many translation contributions</li></ul></li></ul></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="li-zhaoqi">Li Zhaoqi<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#li-zhaoqi" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-foo">Project: Foo<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-foo" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give an intro to the project here ...</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-2">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-2">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give tools/technologies you learned here.

For example, if <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Panel</code> is a part of the code editor, then <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IPanel</code> declares the methods that other classes can call on a panel. Other classes then only references the methods declared in the interface, while different types of panels implement <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IPanel</code> then determines the actual behaviour.</p> <p>This design makes it easier to develop tests, as test cases can provide stubs to the actual implementations, reducing coupling of components especially in tests. However, this design makes it more difficult for new contributors to trace code 😅, especially when I am not sure which implementation it is supposed to be.</p> <ol start="2"><li>VSCode Extension</li></ol> <p>VSCode actually has quite a number of default extensions, most of which only activates when you open files of the corresponding languages. My second pull request necessitated me to look at <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api">VSCode extension API</a>.</p> <ul><li>The <code class="hljs inline no-lang">package.json</code> specifies the behaviour of each extension. For <code class="hljs inline no-lang">html-language-features</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang">typescript-language-features</code>, the file also specifies when the extension is activated.</li> <li>The default entrypoint <code class="hljs inline no-lang">extension.ts</code> declares the functions to be called when the extension is activated and deactivated. In particular, <code class="hljs inline no-lang">typescript-language-features</code> adds VSCode disposibles, which contribute features to VSCode, such as syntax highlighting, hover text, definition content, implementations, references, etc. In contrast, <code class="hljs inline no-lang">html-language-features</code> starts a client that interacts with a server to provide features to VSCode.</li></ul> <p>My second pull requests touches mainly on <code class="hljs inline no-lang">html-language-features</code>. In the extension, the responsibility of implementing the features lies within the server.</p> <ol start="3"><li>One Class - One Component</li></ol> <p>This is consistent with many modern Javascript framework. In VSCode, each component is declared with a class. The actual DOM element is declared as an instance field. Operations that alter the DOM then references this field.</p> <h3 id="other-observations">Other Observations<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#other-observations" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <ol><li>VSCode Engineering Bot</li></ol> <p>In VSCode, approximately 100 pull requests are merged everyday. VSCode has a dedicated bot to assign a human reviewer to a PR from an external contributor. From my observation, the reviewer assigned is usually the one that has experience in the field, usually the person has commented on or is the creator of the original issue that the PR is addressing.</p> <p>I believe this bot can be quite useful for the CATcher - WATcher. During off-season time, PRs tend to be ignored, because students do not check the repository regularly for external contributions, and PR creators do not request for review. While it can be an issue where the assigned person already graduated or is MIA, there are possible fixes:</p> <ul><li>Reviewing the PR does not strictly need to be done by the assigned person. Other people can hop in as well. The purpose of the bot is then only to make sure that PRs have at least 1 review.</li> <li>The bot can assign the PR to a second person if the first person does not respond after a period of time.</li></ul> <ol start="2"><li>CLA Agreement</li></ol> <p>Before the VSCode Engineering bot even assign the PR to a person, new contributors need to sign an agreement. The agreement is raised by another bot via a comment, below which I could just reply to agree. The gist of the agreement was that I would authorise VSCode to use my code, and that I grant them full patent rights.</p></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <h1 id="markbind">MarkBind<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#markbind" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h1> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="lee-hyung-woon">Lee Hyung Woon<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#lee-hyung-woon" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-source-academy">Project: Source Academy<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-source-academy" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Source Academy is an open source, web-based learning environment for programming developed at NUS.

In order to remove the Object Placement feature, which had not been used by the game storywriting team for years (a fact I knew, as the sole member of the game storywriting team for years), I had to do a deeper dive into the current architecture of the game simulator. I was able to refactor and remove the portions of code that were necessary for doing this, and this led me to also do a deeper dive on how Phaser 3 engine worked - but I also managed to find even more problems while working on this PR, and that formed the bulk of the problems tackled for the next PR.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2836">Game: Refactor Game Simulator (#2836)</a>: This was the major PR I worked on; following <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2805">#2805</a> and <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2810">#2810</a>, I decided to refactor the entire game simulator.

This was also in part influenced by the earlier work in PR <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2810">#2810</a>; with this PR <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2836">#2836</a>, removing or adding a module to the game simulator should now be much easier. The UI of the game simulator was also changed to (1) remove issues with browser window sizing, and (2) use more modern UI components.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/3013">Game: Save game state for staff and admin (#3013)</a>: After <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2836">#2836</a>, I took a bit of a break from the coding work to instead focus on planning for a major overwrite of the game engine itself with the rest of the game team. As we did not manage to complete the planning in time for the next semester, I decided to end off the summer break with a trivial feature that was in demand for some time, in time for the upcoming semester. That was this PR.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/3018">Game: Fix a bug with displaying published chapter data (#3018)</a>: This was another PR to fix a bug right before the start of the upcoming semester.</p></li></ol> <p>As mentioned, between the gap from <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/2836">#2836</a> and <a href="https://github.com/source-academy/frontend/pull/3013">#3013</a>, we had been planning for a massive game engine overwrite that aims to remove poor coding standards / practices that accumulated over the years, and instead incorporate interesting approaches to game development by making use of functional programming to declare scenes in phaser. However, we did not manage to complete the planning in time for the next semester, and are instead aiming to complete this work after AY24/25 Sem 2 (i.e. after graduation).</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-4">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <ol><li><strong>Phaser</strong>: Phaser is a game development framework for JavaScript that is commonly used for web-based games, and forms a core part of the Source Academy game engine. In the past, I did not have to touch much of Phaser, as my other groupmates focused on handling the Phaser portion (while I was mostly in charge of text parsing). Now, with the work on game simulator, I had to become much more familiar with Phaser; using the <a href="https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser">Phaser Documentation</a>, I was able to get up to speed on the different components. I did find Phaser documentation and online resources somewhat lacking, which did take some time to figure out - I recall that I even had to go into the source code for Phaser to figure out an input-related issue (either keyboard or mouse, one of the two).</li> <li><strong>Blueprint</strong>: Blueprint JS is a UI toolkit for React-based web applications, and is the main UI toolkit used for Source Academy. As someone who was much more familiar with Material UI, Blueprint was an interesting tool to learn about - the approaches to UI development was quite different from that of Material UI or React-bootstrap (which were the UI libraries I was most familiat with).</li></ol></div><!--]--></div><!-- dismiss button on the right, not shown if there is a header --><!----></div></div></div> <h1 id="reposense">RepoSense<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#reposense" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h1> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" style="" data-v-19514615><!--Icon and vertical divider for seamless header box--><!----><div class="header-and-body" data-v-19514615><!-- Header wrapper, not rendered if there is no header attribute --><!----><!-- Body wrapper --><div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-19514615><!-- icon on the left, not shown if there is a header --><!----><!-- Icon -- content divider for seamless boxes without the header attribute --><!----><!-- Content wrapper --><div class="contents" style="" data-v-19514615><!--[--><h2 id="chang-si-kai">Chang Si Kai<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#chang-si-kai" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h2> <div><h3 id="project-foo-2">Project: Foo<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-foo-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give an intro to the project here ...</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-5">My Contributions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-contributions-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-5">My Learning Record<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#my-learning-record-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p>Give tools/technologies you learned here.

<ul><li>Backstory: Ironically, react.dev does not use i18n to support translations.
