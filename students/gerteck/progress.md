### Summary

Over the semester, I will be working on MarkBind.

The work will build on previous work done, recorded [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjA6jfa7G_ZNjc8zSWi1hVSMmhbrGUY95k0ytyDCo-Y/edit?usp=sharing)

I also add my inputs and discussions on other issues and PRs where I think it would be helpful.
