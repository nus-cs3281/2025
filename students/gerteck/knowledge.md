### Markbind's Search Utility

#### How Native MarkBind Search works
**Collection of Title and headings in generation:**
* We trace the website generation in `Site/index.ts`.
* When building source files, during the page generation process, `Page.collectHeadingsAndKeywords` records headings and keywords inside rendered page into this.headings and this.keywords respectively.
* When writing site data, the title, headings, keywords are collected into pages object.

**Page Generation and Vue Initialization**
* In `core-web/src/index.js`, the `setupWithSearch()` updates the SearchData by collecting the pages from the site data.
    * `setupWithSearch()` is added as a script in the file template `page.njk` used to render the HTML structure of Markbind pages.
    * This file template is used during the page generation process.
* Note also that `VueCommonAppFactory.js` provides a factory function (appFactory) to set up the common data and methods for Vue application shared between server-side and client-side, and provides the common data properties and methods.
    * In particular, `searchData[]` and `searchCallback()`, which are relevant in the following portion.
    * When using `<searchbar/>`, this is where to use MarkBind's search functionality, we set the appropriate values: ` <searchbar :data="searchData" :on-hit="searchCallback"></searchbar>`

**Vue Components: Searchbar/SearchbarPageItem.vue**
**Searchbar.vue**
* The searchbar uses the `searchData[]` in `data`, filters and ranks the data based on keyword matches and populates the dropdown with `searchbarPageItems`. 
* It calls the `on-hit` function (which `searchCallback` is passed into) when a search result is selected.
* Presentation wise, each search result is represented by a `searchbar-pageitem` vue component.

**SearchbarPageItem.vue**
* Presents the component conditionally based on whether item is a heading or a page title.


#### How the new Markbind PageFind Plugin Works

About [PageFind](https://pagefind.app/): A fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of users bandwidth
as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure.

**Documentation:**
* [PageFind NodeJS Indexing API](https://pagefind.app/docs/node-api/)
* [The types returned by Pagefindâ€™s JavaScript search API](https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/blob/production-docs/pagefind_web_js/types/index.d.ts)

#### **Integration of Pagefind into MarkBind**
It runs after the website framework, and only requires the folder containing the built static files of the website. A short explanation of how it works would be:

* PageFind indexes the static files
    * If pagefind is included as a plugin, we indexSites with PageFind, which writes the index files  _site/pagefind 
* Plugin exposes a pagefind JS API for searching 
    * Alternatively, use pagefind default UI for searching. This is done by processes containers with `id="pagefind-search-input"`, and initialing a default PageFindUI instance on it, not unlike how algolia search works.
* This JS API is used by a custom Vue component searchbar.

### Research on Other SSGs

While working on Markbind, I thought that it would definitely be essential to survey other Static Site Generators and the competition faced by MarkBind. 

Researching other SSGs available (many of which are open source as well) has allowed me to gain a broader picture of the roadmap of MarkBind.

For example, Jekyll is simple and beginner-friendly, often paired with GitHub Pages for easy deployment. It has a large theme ecosystem for rapid site creation. Hugo has exceptional build speeds even for large sites. Other SSGs offer multiple rendering modes (SSG, SSR, CSR) on a per page basis, support react etc. Considering that the community for all these other SSGs are much larger and they have much more resources and manpower to devote, I thought about how MarkBind could learn from these other SSGs.

#### Insights that could be applied to MarkBind

Overall, some insights that can be applied to MarkBind would be to:

* Focus on Content-Heavy Instructional Websites
  * Double down on features tailored for educational, project documentation, and course websites.
  * Highlight built-in components like popovers, tabs, and collapsible panels as unique differentiators.
* Emphasize "Out-of-the-Box" Functionality
  * Simplify onboarding and documentation for new users.
  * Provide all essential features for documentation by default (e.g., diagrams, code snippets, multi-level navigation).
  * Position MarkBind as a solution that minimizes configuration while maximizing flexibility.
  * Provide beginner-friendly guides and videos for quick adoption.
* Develop Pre-Built Templates
  * Create specialized templates for use cases like course sites, research documentation, or user guides.
  * Create ready-made themes/templates focused on education and documentation.
  * Allow users to deploy quickly with minimal setup.
