# Summary
Over the semester, I have been actively contributing to both **CATcher** and **WATcher**. While I spent time fixing bugs in CATcher, my main focus was on identifying and resolving issues that enhance both the user and developer experience in WATcher.

### ðŸ”§ Key Contributions

#### CATcher â€“ Bug Trimming Phase
- Participated in the planning and discussions to implement a new bug-trimming phase [#1301](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/1301)
- Kickstarted development by setting up the new phase page, including model updates, user and auth permissions [#1308](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/1308)

#### WATcher â€“ API Testing Improvements
- Identified the lack of documentation and backend testing, which made contributing new features difficult [#433](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues/433)
- Implemented a GraphQL and API testing sandbox to streamline query testing and development, making it easier for contributors to add new features rather than relying on existing queries [#20](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher-docs/pull/20)

#### WATcher â€“ Dashboard Development
- Initiated planning and discussions for a new **analytics dashboard** to provide a more insightful overview of data [#434](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues/434), [#447](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues/447), [#455](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues/455)

#### ðŸ§  Project Management and Collaboration
