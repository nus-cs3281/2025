I learned about the `ngx-markdown` library while I was working on a fix to preserve whitespace when converting Markdown to HTML. `ngx-markdown` combines multiple different language parsers and renders them in one library. `ngx-markdown` supports Marked, Prism.js, Emoji-Toolkit, KaTeX, Mermaid, and Clipboard.js. I learned about configuring the options for the Markdown HTML element.

### Tool/Technology 2

Marked is the main parser we use for our comment editor in creating/editing issues and responses. I learned that any text that we write in Markdown syntax is converted into HTML elements using Marked. I found out that we can actually override how Marked generates the HTML elements, and we can add more attributes like classes, styles, and even modify the text before rendering it.
