### Gradle
The Gradle build typically include three phases: initialization, configuration and execution.  

There are four fundamental components in Gradle: Projects, build scripts, tasks and plugin.  
  
A project typically corresponds to a software component that needs to be built, like a library or an application. It might represent a library JAR, a web application, or a distribution ZIP assembled from the JARs produced by other projects. There is a one-to-one relationship between projects and build scripts.    
  
The build script configures the project based on certain rules. It can add plugins to the build process, load dependencies and set up and configure tasks, i.e. individual unit of work that the build process will perform. Plugins can introduce new tasks, object and conventions to abstract duplicating configuration block, increasing the modularity and reusability fo the buld script.
