### Angular
CATcher and WATcher are both built using the Angular framework, which is a single-page web appliation framework. Angular comes with a CLI tool to accelerate development.

#### Components
- Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications.
- Generating a component will create a TypeScript file, a HTML file, a CSS file, and a test file.
- The TypeScript class defines the interaction of the HTML template and the rendered DOM structure, while the style sheet describes its appearance.
- The `@Component` decorator in the .ts file identifies the class immediately below it as a component class, and specifies its metadata. It associates a template with the component by referencing the .html file (or with inline code).
- Template syntax
  - A template contains regular html as well as Angular template syntax, which alters the HTML based on the application's logic and the state of application and DOM data. 
  - Templates can use:
    - Data binding
    - Pipes
    - Directives

<!-- ### GraphQL
- GraphQL is a query language, which is a specific syntax used to query a server to request or mutate data

Drawbacks to using a traditional REST API:
- Overfetching
  - Getting back more data than needed -->
