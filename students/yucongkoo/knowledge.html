I faced an <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher-docs/issues/18">issue</a> when setting up the project locally that was related to a default NPM package used by Node to build and compile native modules written in C++. I had to dig deep into how packages were being installed and managed by NPM to resolve the issue and have documented my findings as follows:</p> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong></p> <ul><li>NPM is the default package manager for <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Node.js</code>, helping developers to install and manage packages (i.e. libraries/dependencies) via <code class="hljs inline no-lang">package.json</code></li> <li>NPM hosts a collection of open-source packages at their online registry, where we can then install these packages to be used in our project</li> <li>Packages can be installed globally (i.e. system wide) or locally (i.e. per project, under the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">node_modules/</code> folder)</li> <li>Installation of packages is essentially pulling the source code of the package from NPM online registry, and will be ran locally when required. Hence it is possible (but certainly not recommended) to modify the pulled source code locally, as mentioned in one of the workarounds to this <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher-docs/issues/18">issue</a></li></ul> <p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules">https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules</a></p> <h4 id="custom-script-definitions">Custom script definitions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#custom-script-definitions" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><strong>Issue faced:</strong>
I realised that we were using a npm command that I was very unfamiliar with, that is <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm run ng:serve:web</code>, and I wondered what this command meant</p> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong></p> <ul><li>When running commands in the form of <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm run &lt;command&gt;</code>, e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm run ng:serve:web</code>, these commands are actually self-defined scripts under the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">package.json</code> file.</li> <li>These are different from built-in npm commands, e.g. <code class="hljs inline no-lang">npm build</code></li></ul> <p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-run-script">https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-run-script</a></p> <hr> <h3 id="nvm-node-version-manager">NVM (Node Version Manager)<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#nvm-node-version-manager" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <p><strong>Issue faced:</strong>
CATcher uses Node 16 while WATcher uses Node 14 to build, it was hard to switch between node versions quickly when working on both projects</p> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong>

This helps increasing the modularity and scalability of the whole application.</p> <p>As a developer coming from React, here are some clear differences I have observed:</p> <ul><li>There is no concept of states in Angular and the data passing is 2-ways, when the user updates from the UI, the value is automatically updated in the component and vice versa, whereas in React we would have to use states and explicitly update the states via setState or similar functions.</li> <li>Instead of defining the layout of componenet and logic in the same file, Angular split them into 2 seperate files (i.e. the html and typescript file), personally I felt that this split helps enforce the MVC architecture more strictly, but also imposes more restrictions when it comes to components that have tightly coupled logic</li></ul> <p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://v17.angular.io/guide/component-overview">Angular Component Overview</a></p> <h4 id="component-lifecycle">Component Lifecycle<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#component-lifecycle" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>Angular components has a lifecycle that goes from <strong>Initialization</strong> --&gt; <strong>Change detection</strong> --&gt; <strong>Destruction</strong>.
Our application can use lifecycle hooks methods to tap in on the key events of the lifecycle of a component, this is crucial for the fact that we do not have states like we do in React, and we would often want to perform certain operations during key changes to the component.</p> <p>This knowledge was crucial to understanding and fixing an existing CATcher bug (<a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/1349">PR</a>), where the bug could be fixed by tapping on key changes to the issue model used in the component.</p> <p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://v17.angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks">Angular Component Lifecycle</a></p> <hr> <h3 id="catcher">CATcher<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#catcher" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h4 id="issuetablescomponent-and-how-issues-are-being-shown-in-tables">IssueTablesComponent and how issues are being shown in tables<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#issuetablescomponent-and-how-issues-are-being-shown-in-tables" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p>While working on issue <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/1309">#1309</a>, I had to delve deep into how the the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IssueTablesComponent</code> is implemented in order to create new tables. A few meaningful observations learnt is summarised as follows:</p> <ul><li>The issues displayed in the table is mainly dependent on 2 things,
<ul><li>The base issues data provided by <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IssueService</code>, which is initialized based on <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IssuesFilter</code>, and will periodically pull the issues from github</li> <li>The <code class="hljs inline no-lang">filters</code> we inject when creating the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IssueTablesComponent</code>, where the base issues can be filtered down to the issues that we are concerned of</li> <li>The action buttons and its respective functionalities are pre-defined in the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IssueTableComponent</code> itself, we only specify the action buttons that we want when creating the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">IssuesTablesComponent</code> through the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">actions</code> input.</li></ul></li></ul> <hr> <h3 id="github-workflows-actions">Github Workflows/Actions<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#github-workflows-actions" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h4 id="how-github-workflows-actions-are-being-triggered">How github workflows/actions are being triggered<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#how-github-workflows-actions-are-being-triggered" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><strong>Issue faced:</strong>
While working on the new phase (i.e. bug-trimming phase) for CATcher, the team decided to
use a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">feature-bug-trimming</code> branch as the target branch we all merge into. However, I noticed that when we created PRs / merged PRs to that feature branch (see this <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/1320">issue</a> for more details), there are no github workflows/actions being run. This puts us at the risk of failing tests without knowing, I spent some time to learn how github workflows/actions are being triggered.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong></p> <ul><li>The potential trigger points for workflows are defined under the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">on:</code> section within the workflow file (i.e. <code class="hljs inline no-lang">.yml</code> file)</li> <li>We can automatically trigger the workflows when we <code class="hljs inline no-lang">push</code> or <code class="hljs inline no-lang">pull-request</code> to certain branches that are included:</li></ul> <pre><code class="hljs"><span>on:

</span><span>  # Similar to push:, but for PRs towards the included branches
</span><span>  pull_request:

As both CATcher and WATcher involves heavy interaction with the GitHub API(i.e. GitHub acts like our database), I often ran into issues related to the models that we retrieve from the Github API:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/1310">Problematic RestGithubIssueState value #1310</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/1313">Redundant fetching of GitHub issues: Duplicated REST &amp; GraphQL API Calls #1313</a></li></ul> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong></p> <ul><li>REST API
<ul><li>Designed for standard HTTP requests and has <strong>fixed endpoints</strong>, hence</li> <li>responses usually have more data than needed by the users, and</li> <li>we might need multiple requests and aggregate data in the application logic to form the final results</li></ul></li> <li>GraphQL API
<ul><li>Designed as a query language, and can <strong>specify exactly what we need in a single request</strong>, hence</li> <li>we can prevent over-fetching or under-fetching</li></ul></li> <li>GitHub adopted both API standards and provides endpoints to both these standards, allowing clients the flexibility to decide on their own what standard they want to use</li> <li>We started off the project with REST APIs, and later on decided to move towards GraphQL APIs as the customized queries fit our use case more (since GitHub is like a database to us). However, in order to prevent making breaking changes to the existing API calls, we decided to not change most of the existing REST API calls that were already implemented.</li></ul> <p><strong>Reference:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">REST API</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql">GraphQL API</a></li> <li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67dc3c80-ba2c-800a-a4ec-d80fe9c5bfcf">ChatGPT&#39;s explanation</a></li></ul> <hr> <h3 id="project-management">Project management<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#project-management" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h3> <h4 id="branch-management-strategies">Branch management strategies<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#branch-management-strategies" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><strong>Issue faced:</strong></p> <p>While working on WATcher features, there were team members working on bug fixes that are supposed to be deployed
in the next version, as well as team members working on new features that are supposed to be deployed in future versions. The work being done for future versions could not be merged to <code class="hljs inline no-lang">main</code> branch as they are not supposed
to be deployed in the next version.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong></p> <p>We explored multiple possible strategies (discussed in <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues/427#issuecomment-2705558358">this</a> issue thread)</p> <ul><li>We agreed that such scenarios where different team members are working on different future versions are very unlikely, and it wouldn&#39;t really make sense to have a branching workflow specifically for such scenarios</li> <li>Hence, we are proceeding with the original workflow, where each new feature will have a feature branch and will be merged to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">main</code> branch once completed</li></ul> <h4 id="release-management-strategies">Release management strategies<a class="fa fa-anchor" href="#release-management-strategies" onclick="event.stopPropagation()"></a></h4> <p><strong>Issue faced:</strong></p> <p>We noticed that CATcher and WATcher were using different release management/deployment strategies, the differences are stated in <a href="https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues/429">this</a> issue.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge gained:</strong></p> <p>We explored multiple possible release management and deployment strategies, and concluded that the automated workflow used in WATcher is not necessary more streamlined, as it would require additional PR to a <code class="hljs inline no-lang">deploy</code> branch in order to trigger the deployment. In cases where we need to have hotfixes / cherry-pick certain releases, it would be even more troublesome, as we would need to create a seperate branch to include the hotfixes, then PR that branch to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">deploy</code> branch to trigger the deployment.</p> <p>Hence, we standardized the deployment workflow to be manually triggered from github actions, and it would target a specific branch to be deployed. This strategy is more convenient as we would be able to directly deploy from <code class="hljs inline no-lang">main</code> when we decide to create a new release, and when there are further changes/hotfixes required, we could simply branch out from that specific commit that were deployed (we use tagging so that these commits can be easily found) and apply the hotfixes, then deploying from that branch directly. Notice that this strategy is actually similar to the release branching workflow, but in the sense where we don&#39;t create a branch for the first release (we simply tag the commit on <code class="hljs inline no-lang">main</code>), but if hotfixes are needed, we would then be in the same workflow as release branching</p></div> <nav id="page-nav" class="fixed-header-padding" data-v-6b1b63d2><!--[--><div class="nav-component slim-scroll"></div><!--]--><!--v-if--></nav></div> <footer><div class="text-center"><p>[<strong>This site was generated using <img src="https://markbind.org/favicon.ico" width="25"> <a href="https://markbind.org/">MarkBind 6.0.0</a></strong> on Thu, 1 May 2025, 16:00:39 UTC]<br> <span class="dimmed"><small><small>favicon.ico of this site was made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons" title="Smashicons">Smashicons</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></small></small></span></p></div></footer><!--]--></div>
