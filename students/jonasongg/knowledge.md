### RepoSense Backend

During CS3281, I focused more on the frontend portion, and so I had to catch up on RepoSense's backend this time round, especially since much of this batch's code reviews were on the backend.

### Code Reviewing
Code reviewing is, as I learnt, not an easy task. I had to learn how to read other people's code, understand the context of their changes, and provide constructive feedback. I also had to be careful not to miss any details that might affect the functionality of the code. I had to learn how to communicate effectively with the developers, especially when their code was not up to standard or when they needed to make changes.

I also learnt that figuring out the right way to go forward is not a straightforward process. Our discussions as to how to satisfies the constraints on the CLI/CSV since and until dates were complex, and it took effective communication and a clear vision for the project from the mentors to settle on a solution.
