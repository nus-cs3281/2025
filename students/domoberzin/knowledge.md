### Slidev

One of the tools that I started using immediately after learning about it from a lightning talk was sli.dev, which essentially allows one to create presentation slides via familiar Markdown/HTML/CSS. I actually used it for all further presentations I had for the rest of the semester (FYP, 2nd Lightning Talk). With this tool, you are able to create beautiful presentation slides similar to how regular front-end development goes, which was nice in allowing me to revise some CSS concepts as well.

### TMUX

TMUX was also another tool introduced during the lightning talks, and something I found extremely useful. For other projects where I had to run experiments on a separate server, I would typically use `screen` commnds to let my commands run, and even open multiple terminals or rely on VS Code to connect to my remote server. With TMUX, it allowed for quick navigation and context-switching between multiple projects.

### pnpm

A tool I introduced in one of my lightning talks was pnpm, which is a significantly better package manager than yarn/npm, due to its speed and space-saving benefits. I came about it when I was seeing long CI/build times in one of my other projects, and went around googling for how to speed up the traditional `npm install`. Not only is pnpm much faster, it is also the same as npm, from a developer experience point of view, making it a seamless transition.
