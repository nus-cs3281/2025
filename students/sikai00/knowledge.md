### sli.dev and various other developer-tailored slide making tools
 
I had zero familiarity with sli.dev until CS3282, where I was required to deliver lightning talks. 

I had to learn it overnight and it turned out to be surprisingly intuitive for developers. sli.dev is a presentation tool built specifically with developers in mind. sli.dev uses Markdown to create slides, supports code highlighting out of the box, and integrates seamlessly with Git-based workflows. Compared to traditional tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides, sli.dev allows for rapid prototyping of slide decks using plain text, which was well suited for developers like myself. Beyond that there were also interesting features like Shiki Magic Move to animate code snippet changes. I also learnt more about other plain text based slide making tools like revealjs and remarkjs.

### Java records

When I presented on Project Lombok, one of my fellow batchmates questioned me on whether I had heard of this. While I had known of its existence, I did not know what it was about. 

Java Records provide a concise way to declare classes whose main purpose is to hold immutable data. They automatically generate boilerplate code like constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() which are features that Project Lombok also helps with.
