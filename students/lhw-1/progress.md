## CS3282 Progress

### Summary

As a CS3281 student in AY22/23 Semester 2, I have worked on various aspects of the user-oriented aspects of MarkBind, including CLI, template, and logging. Following from this, and adding on what I have learnt over the subsequent few semesters:

For CS3282, in AY24/25 Semester 2, I am focusing on the idea of "Usability" for both users and developers. Following from this theme, it would be great to help develop CLI, Templates, Logging, DevOps, and Documentation side of things, while also being mindful of how we approach UI/UX for components.
