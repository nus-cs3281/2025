### Tool/Technology 1

#### Angular
Angular is the main tool used in both CATcher and WATcher. It is based on TypeScript.

Angular is a component-based framework.
Each component is generated with:
1. *.component.ts
2. *.component.html
3. *.component.css

Component state is maintained in the .ts file.  These state variables can be bound to HTML elements through use of curly braces {{ }}.

Angular offers directives such as ngIf, ngFor that allow us to "use" JS in the HTML files.

Services are used for processing, for tasks that don't involve what the user sees. This is different from the .component file, which directly handles things the users see.
Services are kept in a separate directory /services/*.
