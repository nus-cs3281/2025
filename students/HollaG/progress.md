## Summary
### CATcher
Was part of the team to implement the new phase for PE - bug trimming. Helped to fix up issues and enhance the UI to make it less confusing for students, who may be stressed during a time crunch.
Also helped to smoke test to ensure robustness.

### WATcher
Worked on making the overall UX more enjoyable for the end user. Minor improvements made to the styling and UI to improve accessibility.
Major improvements include
1. Implementing a preset feature
- Created a system to save and load preset filters, which saves time for students looking to only view a subset of students or a subset of all available options.
2. Moving the filter bar to the left
- Enhanced the readability of the filter bar, as the old horizontal layout was difficult to comprehend.

Work was done on refactoring out the Filter type into a dedicated class, but due to time constraints and a more complex-than-expected refactoring process, the work has since been halted. It has been pushed to a feature branch for future students to work on and contribute to.
