### VueJS
VueJS is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, similar to React. It offers reactive data binding and a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable components that allow for parent-child relationships. Vue is used extensively in MarkBind to create and render website components, such as pages, boxes, code blocks, etc.
