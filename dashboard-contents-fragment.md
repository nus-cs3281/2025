The way this is implemented currently may cause some confusion when there are multiple issues closed by the PR or multiple PRs that close the issue. But for non anomalous usage, I think this implementation should be sufficient. Open to any suggestions if you guys have any ideas.

The issues being displayed under each assignee is the issues that are assigned to them, rather than the issues they create. In this case, PRs that close issues that are not assigned to the creator of the PR are considered anomalies, so I believe prof wants a way to identify these on glance (which would be PRs not under any issues).

Currently, the code that was taken from CATcher has all Issues and PRs as under the Issue class, differentiated by the IssueOrPr field. This is not very good practice, and has caused quite a bit of confusion. 

We should refactor this into two separate classes, Issue and PullRequest.

%%[created at: 2025 Jan 20 17:03:56]%%

**Describe the bug**
Using the templates provided in the code and the online documentation for the tester response phase comment causes the issue to remain under faulty issues

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to the https://catcher-org.github.io/dg/testing.html and copy the **Tester Response Phase** comment format **example**.
2. Go to the CATcher website and navigate to the **Tester Response Phase**.
3. Go to the GitHub page for one of the issues
4. Add or change the existing comment to the copied example.

**Expected behavior**
The issue should not be under **Faulty Issues**.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Feb 08 18:53:00]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Our current e2e testing mocks the issue service to store the issues, while the mocked github service does not handle issue storage at all. However, issue services originally does not have any direct dependencies on external api calls to github. So, it should not be necessary to mock issue services.

By not mocking issue services, we enable e2e testing to test issue.service.ts as well. It is also more in line with how CATcher works, with issue.services.ts asking for data from github.service.ts.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
We could remove mock.issue.service.ts and move the logic to mock.github.service.ts.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The alternative would be to continue mocking the issue service, allowing mock.issue.service.ts to handle all logic to do with mutating issues.

**Additional context**
For example, the following function is found in mock.issue.service.ts, meaning mock.github.service.ts has no access to the issues created here.

Currently, this is being handled by this width check in filter-bar.component.css. An easy fix would be to change this max-width to a width that more accurately represents the width like 1780px. Shall we move forward with this? Or do you guys think there is a more extendable solution?

If the card becomes too cluttered, we can also consider adding a new grouping strategy for grouping by reviewers. 

Pros: Easier to identify unreviewed PRs. Less visual clutter on the card.
Cons: May require overhauling the grouping system. Not sure what to do with issues in this view.

It's probably best to eventually refactor it, but for now I think we can just check the issueOrPr field if we want to get this out the door.

Some things that we should discuss with regards to this feature:

### 1. How to handle multiple PRs fixing the same issue?

There can be multiple PRs fixing the same issue and one PR can fix multiple issues. My suggestion would be to simply display the issue under every PR that claims to fix it. This brings up a separate question of what count should we display? Inclusive or exclusive of duplicates?

### 2. How to handle closed PRs?

If a PR has been closed, we probably don't want to display any issues that it claims to fix under it, so we should probably just ignore closed PRs. This is separate from merged PRs, which we do want to display the fixed issues under.

### 3. How to handle if a PR fixes an issue assigned to another user?

Should we still display the issue under User A's PR if it fixes an issue assigned to User B? I think we should still display it.

### 4. How should this feature be toggled?

Should it be on at all times? Should we add a button to the filter bar? I think it would be okay to keep it on, since if the user wants to search or sort for a specific issue they can always just filter out PRs.

In the context of CS2103T, it would definitely help team members identify if anyone is accidentally using the wrong workflow so they can address it asap. 

If we were to implement it, how should we go about designing the UI? I can think of either placing it next to the milestone badge

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8188f71b-bb89-4d7d-9bb3-42957024674b)

or perhaps overloading the octicon to turn red if it is not using the forking workflow. (Currently, the color of the octicon is identical to the left border, so it is unneeded)

The key problem here is that the value shown in the dropdown of assignees is the variable `this.assignees`, and this value is not updated when the `this.issue` is updated (which is the case when we mark and unmark an issue as duplicate).

@damithc 
When you unmark issue B as a duplicate of Issue A, the assignees of issue B will be kept as the assignees of Issue A, so Adam in the provided scenario.

Same applies to the labels.

@damithc 
Yup the updated scenario is the current behaviour.

The fix included in this PR is for the behaviour when we click on the edit assignees icon.

Behaviour before the fix:
After Issue B is unmarked as a duplicate, it is still assigned to Adam. 
If we click edit assignees, the dropdown will show Betsy (the original assignee to Issue B) is selected.

Behaviour after the fix:
After Issue B is unmarked as a duplicate, it is still assigned to Adam. 
If we click edit assignees, the dropdown will show Adam is selected.

I am not sure if this is the most elegant way to implement this. Basically we need the issue service to be initialised with all the issues (open and closed) for the bug-reporting phase(and bug-trimming phase going ahead). Do let me know if you think there is a better solution to this.

Instead of having a new permission config, I thought that this would make sense, since deleting and restoring are basically opposite actions (one undo-ing the other), their permission should be the same too. I would love to listen inputs on this decision.

This change is to make the workflow when restoring issues identical to deleting issues. If we were to use `updateLocalStore`, the issue remains in the `Issues deleted` table until the next filtering is run in `IssuesDataTable`
<img width="843" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 7 54 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdac82d2-e690-4cb9-b55b-5eba6576dd0e" />

This would seem counter intuitive, see the following video:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec6fef8-62c9-4874-bfe6-9de9272cc592


Hence, I changed the the `undeleteIssue` function to use `deleteFromLocalStore` instead, so that it will disappear immediately after the restore, and during the next issue polling, reappear in the issue posted table (Identical behaviour to deleting issues). I have checked the usage of this `undeleteIssue` function and it is only used originally to undo the delete action, and now also used by the new restore icon. A sample of the result is as follows:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7979950-dbc0-4ab6-94cf-3880a3fbf553

This was not a IDE formatting actually, rather it was one of the pre-commit hooks being ran by husky, and the only way to bypass this (at least from what I know) is via the command `git commit --no-verify`. 

The following is what happens when I try to commit the file where I reverted the changes, and the formatting is being fixed to the new formatting once again (at commit time the file was already saved as the old formatting)
<img width="982" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-08 at 4 37 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e178eb1-ab69-429b-8917-7e9e5a6ab959" />

Personally I think for this case it would be better to use the fixed formatting instead, what do you think?

Ahhh this was my bad, I wasn't aware that `finalize` worked like that.

After understanding more on how `finalize` and `subscribe` works, I believe we would still need to use `finalize` here for the logic that removes the issues from `issuesPendingDeletion` list (if not when the deletion fails, the UI will continuous display the spinner icon), I have refactored the code block as follows:
```
this.issueService
  .deleteIssue(id)
  .pipe(finalize(() => ``{``
    const ``{`` [id]: issueRemoved, ...theRest ``}`` = this.issuesPendingDeletion;
    this.issuesPendingDeletion = theRest;
  ``}``))
  .subscribe(
    (removedIssue) => this.handleIssueDeletionSuccess(id, event, actionUndoable),
    (error) => this.errorHandlingService.handleError(error) 
  );
```

Also, I have also observed that there is high code duplication in the `issues-tables.component.ts` for the functions `deleteIssue` and `undeleteIssue`, I also don't quite like the fact that there is a lot of logic within the `issues-tables.component.html` similar to the following
<img width="1112" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 10 45 42 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54928985-95ad-4cc5-91d0-3db5ed912772" />

But I don't want to do too much refactoring as this would increase the difficulty of reviewing the PR. Hence I plan to create a separate Issue to work on refactoring these issues.

@Eclipse-Dominator  I have addressed the issues mentioned above!

> We can just tell them the bug deleted are just hidden and can be restored during bug trimming phases. I dont think having the 2nd table with the concept of delete and restore adds much value to the users during the bug reporting phase UNLESS hidden bugs will not be transferred to the bug trimming phase.

Yeah this design of 2 tables was the design we thought of for the bug trimming phase, but prof Damith suggested that we could make these 2 phases to use the same design since it just provides more flexibility, we might want to have a more in-depth discussion on how the UI/UX for these 2 phases.

Currently the bug-trimming phase is still being set up, so I think implementing this now would be beneficial to just port the code over for bug-trimming phase anyways(and we can discover potential issues earlier too).

I like how this change makes it clearer what fields we are using for issues and PRs, however, the more ideal solution would be to create separate models for issues and PRs, instead of using the same model now. We can create a separate issue for this refactoring though!

From my point of view, defaulting initialisation to 100 seems a little counter-intuitive, as readers of this code might think that this default value was used somewhere in some scenario. Do correct me if I am wrong and this 100 was indeed used somewhere!

Have some suggestions regarding possible refactoring though(could possibly create a separate issue for this):
It seems like the sub-components (i.e. IssueComponent, IssuesDeletedComponent, IssuesPostedComponent) are all identical to the ones from bug-reporting, would it be possible to just reference those components instead to reduce code duplication?

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 10 12:37:41]%%

Currently the deployment workflow in WATcher is different from CATcher.

CATcher:
1. PR to main, updating the version
2. Create version tag for the commit we want to deploy (e.g. v3.6.0)
3. Manually trigger the deployment workflow from the commit

WATcher:
1. PR to main, updating the version
2. PR from main to `deploy` 
3. Deployment runs automatically when there are changes to the `deploy` branch

We think that the CATcher workflow provides more flexibility (and is less troublesome as we only have to PR once, whereas in WATcher we have to PR twice), so we are requesting to change the workflow in WATcher to follow the workflow in CATcher.

%%[created at: 2025 Jan 14 17:32:22]%%

After further investigation, this seems to be a versioning issue, see the following GitHub [thread](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/30368)

We are using ubuntu-latest in our GitHub runner (i.e. ubuntu 24.04), which is incompatible with the playwright version we are using (i.e. playwright ~1.33).

There are 2 solutions as proposed in the following stack overflow [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79090211/playwright-tests-in-github-actions-error-for-webkit-with-host-system-is-missing) (as well as in the GitHub thread provided above):
Solution 1: upgrade playwright to v1.48 (or above)
Solution 2: downgrade ubuntu to v22.04

Solution 1 would be a better solution for the long term, but playwright [v1.48](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/test/v/1.48.2) requires node version >= 18, while CATcher is currently on node v16.x, hence would be more troublesome to upgrade node version
Solution 2 can be easily implemented by specifying the ubuntu version in the GitHub workflow
Hence I would prefer implementing solution2 for the fix

Currently, the UI for bug reporting phase only supports creating new issue and deleting issues, we need a UI that can also un-delete issues

**Describe the solution you'd like**
We should update the UI to have 2 tables, where the top table will show the list of open issues, and the bottom table will show the list of deleted issues, users can then click the delete icon on issues in the top table to delete the open issues, and click the restore icon (new icon) on the bottom table to un-delete the issue.

# User related workflows decisions to be made:
1.  Currently when users click on the delete icon, there will be a dialog pop-up prompting confirmation as follows

<img width="610" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cedfe2fd-b777-4ac1-a94d-1d02878b6fee" />

My question: Clearly this action will become reversible under the new design (where users can see a table of deleted issues and restore them during bug-reporting and bug-trimming phase), do we still keep this confirmation dialog? Personally I think I would prefer to just remove this confirmation dialog (since the action is no longer with heavy consequences and users can easily restore the deleted issues)

2. Currently after the users confirm deletion of the issue, there will be a snackBar pop up that allows user to undo the deletion as follows:

<img width="413" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/838e97e0-0aad-4475-a3f8-020df4476c45" />

2. View issue page for deleted issues, note that as the permission for users are granted to edit/delete/create issues during this phase, this page is totally same as the original view issue page (i.e. users can still edit deleted issues)

Yup, perfectly fine to keep it as it is.

Yeah I think this makes sense, from the outside we can strikethrough the title, then when users click into the ViewIssuePage we make a separate (less prominent) view of the it, with no functionality to edit/delete/create new issue (we should probably add a new button `recover` to be shown in this new view also?). I'm thinking shall this be a separate issue from this PR after we gather more suggestions?

Thanks for your suggestions @Eclipse-Dominator !

> Just remove the edit buttons or disable them should do this so keeping the page is good enough. This effectively removes all access to edit/delete/create issues, thus, "restricting" access by disabling these functionalities in the UI.

Yup, initially I was thinking that allowing them to have access on editing is fine, but after thinking more about it, although there is no harm allowing them to do that, it doesn't really make sense too. 

> Teams should also be able to set duplicates issues here as well.

If I am not mistaken, there is no concept of duplicate bugs in this `bug-reporting` phase (and the new `bug-trimming` phase too) right?


> Might be worth considering if this should be turned into a new component or just add a phase check / `@Input` to the component

Yeah I am considering that this should potentially be a new component now, will discuss further with the team regarding this new component.

Great idea!

Hmm I have a different point of view with this, I think that a common scenario would be student reporting a bunch of bugs during the `bug-reporting` phase without deleting any, then they will end up with a lot of bugs in the 1st table initially during the new `bug-trimming` phase. The search bar and pagination will then become helpful in such scenarios.

> As for functionality behaviors
>

Yup this is the delete icon in the 1st table.

> * Issues in the 2nd table can be "moved" up to 1st table should there be enough space

As suggested by prof Damith, we are not restricting the "space" in the 1st table, hence they can always move issues from the 2nd table up to the 1st table


> * Issues in the 2nd table can replace an issue in the first table (show another button to mean replace) &lt;-- suggestion?

This one sounds like a good idea! Will check with the team if we want to implement this in the future (probably not required in this first version of implementation)

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Feb 04 16:28:34]%%

**Describe the bug**
In `github-issue-filter.model.ts`, the value of type` RestGithubIssueState` is problematic for 'close':
<img width="607" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6feb5fea-63e5-466f-9c25-27b9183cd132" />
As the GitHub Api expects this value to be 'closed' instead of 'close'.

Although the value is correctly converted to 'closed' in the `convertToGraphqlFilter()` method, we use the pre-converted filter in `toFetchIssues()` method:

<img width="938" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fdb541-ff9b-44db-8bb3-a81899537db3" />


**To Reproduce**
I discovered this bug as we require to fetch closed issues in the new feature, a simply way to reproduce this problematic behaviour is to try fetching closed issues for bug reporting phase (i.e. with filter: FilterByCreator):

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to `issue.service.ts` file, `initializeData` method and add the `state: close` filter as follows:

<img width="1040" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef467346-5853-479f-831b-614e9aa2c667" />

2. Run the application and you will notice that no issues are being loaded:

**Expected behavior**
We should be able to fetch closed issues using the filters added above

While implementing the new UI for bug reporting phase in [#1312](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/1312), I noticed some places that I could be further improved in terms of code quality, mainly the following 2 aspects:

- Duplication of code between `deleteIssue` and `undeleteIssue`, they are essentially performing the same actions, but in reverse directions, hence the code is highly duplicated. 
- There are 2 separate lists `issuesPendingDeletion` and `issuesPendingRestore`, which is used for displaying the loading icon (instead of the delete/restore icon), we can actually merge these 2 lists into a single list (maybe `issuesPendingAction`?) instead and display the loading icon  (and hide the delete/restore icon) based on this list
- There is a lot of conditional logic in the `issue-tables.component.html` file, we should probably move these logic into the `issue-tables.component.ts` file instead. See the `*ngIf=...`

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

For non-mac user:
See most recent GitHub action [here](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/actions/runs/13520559956)

For Mac users:
run `npm run test` on CATcher repo and see output

**Expected behavior**
The tests should pass (as it is passing on other OS)

After tracing the status of this action, it seems like this error started to appear since [this run](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/actions/runs/11107477281), which is 5 months later than the last passing [run](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/actions/runs/8861295761).

Clearly the changes made in that commit would not be the root cause of this failure. Hence I tried to search the web for issues relating to this and found a thread [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/28271#issuecomment-2319380288)

Although not very sure about the issue, but seems like it is caused by Karma.

In my opinion, I think that making the filters vertical and stick to the left is the best alternative, as it would be intuitive for users to scroll vertically to view the different filter options (as compared to scrolling horizontally).

> With the second option I think it would be good if the dropdown opened to the right of the dropdown root, thus resolving my concerns and making the filters more extensible.

Yeah I agree with this suggestion.

In short,I think the best alternative is go with option 2 (vertical filters) + open dropdown to the right.

The changes required to add a draft PR option in the status field is non-trivial, this is mainly due to the reason that although it seems intuitive that `draft` is a state of its own, the reality is that `draft` is not a state, but an additional boolean `isDraft` field. 

TLDR, a `draft` PR can be either `open` or `closed` state (although in our application logic we only check whether a PR is draft or not when the PR is in open state, creating a sense that draft PRs are always open), hence I don't think it really make sense to add a Draft PR option to our Status filter.

If we really want this option, we should probably add another filter instead

I was able to reproduce the described behaviour.

However, I am not super sure if this is really a bug, as the hidden labels functionality is kind of like a UI functionality (it is not related to what labels to fetch from GitHub, hence this information is not incorporated into the URL). Feels like even if you copy the URL and the hidden labels are gone, it is still an acceptable behaviour to me.

To add on, notice that when you click the `remove all` to remove selections of labels, the hidden is not removed as well.

Hmm but wouldn't the proposed workflow be problematic as the 2 feature versions are now developed in parallel. 
'''mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    commit id: "v1.1 starts"
    branch v1.1
    checkout v1.1
    commit id: "Work on v1.1"
    checkout main
    commit id: "v1.2starts"
    branch v1.2
    checkout v1.2
    commit id: "Work on 1.2"
    checkout v1.1
    commit id: "More work on v1.1"
'''
In the above scenario, both feature branches are divergent and changes made to be v1.1 will not be pulled to v1.2 (and when v1.1 eventually gets merged to main, and merged to v1.2, there might be alot of merge conflicts happening and discovered late)

Instead I think we should probably stick to the current workflow, where we create release branches from main when necessary. As the chances of having to work on features in future iterations is low and will likely only happen when we are going to release the current iteration soon.

'''mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    commit id: "Work on v1.1"
    branch release/v1.1
    checkout release/v1.1
    commit id: "released v1.1"
    checkout main
    commit id: "work on v1.2"
    branch v1.2
    checkout v1.2
    commit id: "More work on v1.1"
'''

Then in the case of patches to the release/v1.1, we should branch out from release/v1.1 and merge the fix to both release/v1.1 and main

@damithc  
Good suggestion. I agree that the functionality is ambiguous. I think that making a slider button would be better, as the user might not hover to the icon and hence wouldn't know about this possible functionality.

In my opinion, if the users want to focus on either PRs or Issues, they could filter by type, and if they decide to filter by all (i.e. PRs and Issues), they would probably want to see everything and don't really need the very distinct differentiation between PR and Issue. 

I don't have a good idea on how we can make it distinct and still keep the elegance we have currently. For example we could make the card styling for PRs and Issues very different, but the UI will have a mix of different cards, and that might be slightly weird for me.

Let's see what the others think!

Good suggestion. This feature does sound like a good to have, we would likely not need to analyse the PR descriptions in our application logic, instead we could change the query used to fetch PRs to also fetch the issues that the PR closes (I quickly searched up and we should be able to use `closingIssuesReferences ` field in PR objects).

However, from the technical side, this increases the difference between the PR objects and Issue Objects, and in our application we are modelling them as the same `Issue` class (although they already have certain differences), so I think we should first do some refactoring to create different models for Issue and PR before we start implementing this change. I think that the refactoring would be non-trivial and might need quite big effort. What do the others think?

Extract from `github.service.ts`:
<img width="1122" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d78e640-5929-47dd-b47c-1be48085f5e9" />

Understand that the current problem is as follows:
When using Github REST api (i.e. `octokit.issues.update` in the example above), we are casting the `response.data` to `GithubIssue`, which is the model for GraphQl GitHub issues. Hence, the value of states attribute is incorrect (`open` instead of `OPEN` and `close` instead of `CLOSE`), and potentially many other attributes too.

Note that this problem is also present in `reopenIssue` and `createIssue`.

> Thus it would be good to standardize this (I would recommend just switching over to GraphQL mutate API instead of using Github REST API to standardize across the application.

This sounds like quite a big change, i.e. we will have to migrate the api calls for these 3 methods to GraphQl, are we sure we want to proceed with this? 

Or do we put in a less risky workaround (i.e. update the states to the correct GraphQl states without changing the api call)?

Yup I think this would be the safer choice considering that we are already rolling out quite a big change for this new phase/

Sorry, could you elaborate more about this? I couldn't quite get the what update and save are we combining with.

This issue is related to how we are constructing our `Octokit` object, as mentioned in the warning, if we were to use `@octokit/rest` of version >= v17, we would need to add an `authStrategy` option to indicate how we are authenticating (OAuth in our use case). 

Considering that we are able to perform these upgrade now (i.e. `@octokit/rest` to v17 without having to upgrade any other dependencies), I will try to work on this and remove the deprecation warning (so that future upgrades can be performed smoother).

Thanks for reporting this issue @Incogdino , indeed a good catch.

After some investigation, I would think that the current behaviour is actually as follows:

1. After marking Issue A as duplicate of Issue B, the assignees will be set the the assignees of Issue B. 
2. After unmarking Issue A as duplicate(i.e. no longer duplicate of Issue B), the assignees are actually remained as assignees of Issue B. (Note that if we went back to the table view at this point, the assignees are not actually reassigned back to the original assignees of Issue A, see the following video for reference)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e060f689-4575-4f41-b241-2457a5255a22

However, there is indeed a bug here, where if instead of returning to the table view right after unmarking Issue A as duplicate, the user click on the assignees edit icon, the dropdown shows the original assignees of Issue A, the expected behaviour should be the dropdown showing the assignees of Issue B.

We will look into fixing this issue! Thanks again for reporting.

On a larger repo, future counts can probably break into another row.

On milestone view, would you still want it to be aligned to the left? Centre might be better in my opinion

Thanks for creating the new page that we will be working on! However, I was wondering if instead of using a new button, would adding a new option in the current view drop down be better? For example adding a 'Dashboard' option here.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6fabfc8-ad28-44e9-94b4-11b6783af076)

Perhaps we can see what others think about these 2 options.

Otherwise, LGTM!

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Jan 28 00:30:52]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
While trying to fix #395 I realised that all predefined filter options are done using magic strings. This makes it hard for me to create a mapping for options to URL encoding.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/572e1983-f89e-43bd-803f-85e79842e9ff)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Perhaps it would be a good idea to move all magic strings for filters into enums or constants

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Perhaps an alternative would be to leave it as it is and create a mapping for the encoding using strings with the same value

**Additional context**
I am planning to create a mapping for URL encoding to allow filters when users click `view on github`.
'''TS
const mapping = ``{``
    'open pullrequest' = 'is%3Apr%20AND%20is%3Aopen'

When the user is using a minimized version of watcher the dropdown filter section has no clear hierarchy between the filter section and the dashboard

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to WATcher
2. Shrink the window or zoom in till the dropdown filter is available
3. Click on filter
4. You will see that the dashboard looks cut off by the filter

**Expected behavior**
Perhaps a light drop shadow or border can be used to let the user know that their filter section is open. Open to discussion

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 15 02:00:39]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
While I was working on a new feature, I found testing and understanding the queries and parameters to be hard as we can only change them in code, run them then check the network tab.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I decided to use Postman to test and try out different queries

Here is a simple example of testing and running using Postman

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d253045-4b6c-482a-8435-60c5d6917df0)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0750de89-3e18-42e7-95a8-9c34da55883a)

We will be able to test graphql queries first without having to touch any code.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Maybe another solution would be to use [octokit-playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) library as we are already using octokit to run the queries

[Github Explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer) works great too as there is no need for any extra authentication.

**Additional context**
Perhaps having more information for testing and learning might make it easier for other contributors and encourage implementing more complex features using graphql.

Perhaps we can consider
- Postman with a collection of all the queries built-in with variables (reduce the need of having setup queries every time we want to use it)
- Github explorer, easy to use however, every query requires setting up relevant variables

I have created new documentation for WATcher-docs to include the use of Postman and other relevant documentations. The PR can be found [here ](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher-docs/pull/20).

The relevant Postman workspace can be found [here](https://www.postman.com/orange-station-77364/watcher/overview).

Here are some images of the workspace.

Running queries and checking the response

Basic query

Exploring `FetchPullRequests` query

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81566034-86fe-49f5-9303-294ff24ccda9)

Being able to test and run queries without have to write any code makes it easier to debug, test and create new queries. I believe this will be beneficial for current and future developers.

I have currently included the GraphQL queries used in WATcher. Do let me know if you would like another queries perhaps some simple ones such that future developers can build on top of it.

Reviews and comments play a crucial role in project development. To better track contributions, we should include them as a metric.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to an issue with a 'team's response'
2. Copy example found in [user workflow](https://catcher-org.github.io/dg/user-workflow.html)
3. Issue will be under 'Faulty Issues' in CATcher

**Expected behavior**
Issue should move to 'Issues Pending Response'

**Screenshots**

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4be251e-9d6c-4d18-8ca6-a97476fc9776)

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

- OS: Windows 11
- Browser Chrome
- Version 131.0.6778.86

**Additional context**
From further investigation. The issue comes from 'Team chose ['type.DocumentationBug'].' and '**Reason for disagreement:**'.

1. The parser expects ''Team chose ['type.DocumentationBug']' how in the example an additional '.' is supplied.
2. The parser expects '**Reason for disagreement:** ' as seen in [tester response section parser](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/blob/master/src/app/core/models/templates/section-parsers/tester-response-section-parser.model.ts). However, when directly copied, the additional whitespace at the end is removed.

**Possible solutions**
1. Remove the '.' at the end of the issue descriptions
2. Preserving the white space could be similar to #1273 

Performing the above 2 possible solutions produces the expected results.

You should see the box tooltip above the side menu. You can try it for yourself in [WATcher docs](https://catcher-org.github.io/WATcher-docs/dg/index.html)



### Expected behavior

The tooltip box should be below left side menu

### Anything else?

@tlylt Thanks for the reply! I have tested it out. The issue exists as well on my local machine with the latest markbind after I delete all previously generate files.

The site nav section seems to fit the usage in the UG as well. May I ask how did you manage to get it to work by setting the element position to `relative`? I tried a few ways on my end and could not get it to work. Thank you!

Perhaps an accordion for the options might work too. So instead of having the options be a popup that overlaps other components, the accordion will expand downwards. The persistent open and close will also allow users to change the settings quickly as well to view different states. This prevents any overlaps of components with potential extra benefits. A drawback that I can think of is that users will have to manually close the accordion.

I actually encountered this too during my development for "View on Github". I decided to leave it as it is as it would still allow users to search by the other filters too instead of using github's global search.

Furthermore, the search behaviour of WATcher feels more accurate as it searches for partial text too. Therefore it would not be ideal to make WATcher match GitHub search.

I believe leaving it as-is and informing users will be the better choice for now! Let's see what the other think.

I agree with this. While coming up with #434 perhaps we can have something like this format

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6772bd2-5345-45a9-b08b-4d7d75579fdf)

Where the numbers are separated with `|`.

Or perhaps we can show the separate count as a tooltip following the same format I just mentioned above when users hover over the overall count.

I am currently experimenting with the layout. I have come up with this, however, I realised that some names get broken up into 2 lines in awkward positions (AudreyFelicio). Not sure if using icons would make the count take up too much space.

Let me know what you all think, and I shall improve on it.

I think it is a good idea perhaps #408 can take these suggestions into consideration as well! 

By doing a quick check on postman we can actually get reviewers as well by adding a few extra fields I am able to get there reviewers along side the current query that we are using in `FetchPullRequests`. Not sure if adding new fields will generate any additional API calls.

Sample query
```
query FetchPullRequests($owner: String!, $name: String!, $cursor: String) ``{``
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) ``{``
    pullRequests(first: 100, after: $cursor) ``{``
      edges ``{``
        cursor
        node ``{``
          ...pullrequest
          isDraft
          labels(first: 100) ``{``
            edges ``{``
              node ``{``
                ...issueLabel
              ``}``
            ``}``
          ``}``
          assignees(first: 100) ``{``
            edges ``{``
              node ``{``
                ...issueAssignee
              ``}``
            ``}``
          ``}``
          reviewRequests(first: 10) ``{``
            nodes ``{``
              requestedReviewer ``{``
                ...requestedReviewerDetails
              ``}``
            ``}``
          ``}``
          reviews(first: 10) ``{``
            nodes ``{``
              author ``{``
                ...reviewAuthor
              ``}``
              state

          ``}``

@damithc , on further thought, it might look a little weird with the table not having any borders.

Would this border color be OK? Same color as the row dividers.

I had actually considered that, one (alternative) thing which I tried was to have the 
`this.isDefault = this.selectedLabelNames.size === 0 && this.deselectedLabelNames.size === 0 && this.hiddenLabelNames.size === 0`

set in `updateSelection()` also,

but that broke all the test cases as for e.g. the test case for `hide` was only expecting `filterService.updateFilters` to be called with a change in `hiddenLabels`. I left it for now as I thought the test cases shouldn't really be changed.

In that way, we wouldn't need to have yet another function, but I wasn't sure whether I should be changing test cases.

Looks good, do you suggest simply moving all instances of `this.filtersService.updateFilters` into `updateSelection?`

Would it be OK to do everything in this PR instead? It might result in unnecessary duplication of work if I do another PR which then results in merge conflicts, having to redo this PR.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Jan 23 16:52:49]%%

**Describe the bug**
The filter bar overflows the screen in certain screen sizes. This causes a scroll bar to appear for the whole page. On repositories that have too many issues to fit in one page, there are now 2 scroll bars.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1c3ada-9f00-40b5-9934-dabb0d3996ba)

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Open a repository that is big e.g. https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods
2. Scroll to the bottom

**Expected behavior**
Only 1 scroll bar

One slightly more radical idea is, instead of having the filters at the top, we move it to become vertical at the left side instead.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feafc141-8471-424d-ae2a-ede53138bba2)

We can then have a button that will "hide" or "expand" the filters when needed.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
There already exists two "default" custom views for users. Let's allow users to save a custom selection of filters.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A save button can be provided (location TBC). This could open a dialog asking the user to choose a label. Upon save, this would appear in the current dropdown (for contributions / currently active). As we have no backend, we can potentially simply save the configs in localstorage (non-sensitive, anyway)

Some initial ideas~
- As mentioned, we can store the url parameters (perhaps in LocalStorage - it doesn't have to be secure) 
- It should be repository-specific. We can allow users to set a custom name for the saved filter.
_a potential enhancement is that we can allow them to choose a default view / default filter to be applied on load_
- CR D operations should be allowed ( no need for update as they can simply delete the filter and re-add it)

we could use the following schema:
[in localstorage]
key=repositoryname
value: type 
```
``{`` 
  name: String,
  filter: String // the url
``}``[]
```

Upon further inspection, there already exists a `repo-url-cache-service.ts` that caches repository names. We can make use of the same name to save the custom filters.

Behaviour upon filters becoming invalid
Use case: when a label or milestone gets deleted / closed
Option 1: ignore and filter based on other options
- this is the current behaviour, same when sharing URL

Option 2: Remove the saved filter set
- THere is currently no behaviour implemented in the URL parser to tell if there is an invalid filter applied.
- This could perhaps be a new PR to remove it from the URL as well upon detecting invalid filter

This issue is much more difficult than expected. The main difficulty arises from the fact that models are a class type. The current `filter` is treated as a type `Filter`, that's why `Partial&lt;Filter>` is used without issues when passing into functions such as `FiltersService#updateFilters`. However, this would not be good practice when it is a class `Filter` instead of a type `Filter`. Thus, we need to update all references of `Partial&lt;Filter>`, which is a non-trivial task.

> However, I am not super sure if this is really a bug, as the hidden labels functionality is kind of like a UI functionality (it is not related to what labels to fetch from GitHub, hence this information is not incorporated into the URL). Feels like even if you copy the URL and the hidden labels are gone, it is still an acceptable behaviour to me.

I'm not too sure about this as well, because it might look like a bug, especially when the 3-state checkbox does carry over in the URL.

Up for discussion.

**51 :octicon-issue-opened:** (created issue #427: Use feature-branches instead of merging to main)
</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 07 11:32:51]%%

As WATcher is nearing its official release cycle, we start to run into the issue where we would like to work on features / issues that are slated for different version releases. 
For example, a developer(s) could be working on a bug fix for the immediate version v1.1 while another developer(s) could be working on a big feature for version v1.2.

Currently, as everything is merged to main, PRs for incremental work done on the feature for version v1.2 are unable to be merged, as it would pollute the main branch.

Hence, I instead propose the use of feature branches like so:

[1] The main branch remains fully working at all times
[2] When a developer wants to start working on the next version, they will branch off main in the upstream repo, following the convention release-v[major].[minor].
[3] When a developer wants to start working on the following versions, in the upstream repo, they can branch off the latest feature branch.
Subsequent updates can be merged into the upstream feature branch.

When it's time for release, a PR can be made from the feature branch to main. Thus, prod can remain to be built from main.


To discuss! Please do suggest alternatives or any opinions you guys might have.

Maybe we can take some inspiration from Carousell? They lay out the most common filter options, and then have a "more filters" button that opens a side drawer.

### Common filter options
1. Search
2. Type
3. Status

I agree with @yucongkoo , here are some ideas I briefly came up with:

1. Split each column into 2 sub columns, one for issues, one for PRs 
- Not really a good idea IMO

2. The above, but we have two distinct sections for "Issues" and "PR"s e.g.

### HollaG
**Issues**
issue1
issue2

**PRs**
PR1
PR2

3. Visually differentiate the two types of cards using a rounded / sharp border 
- May or may not be obvious enough

However, I still maintain that the distinction is not strictly necessary as if a user feels like they want to only focus on issues, they can simply engage the type filter.

Would the end goal of WATcher be to be also used in projects where the forking workflow is not actually used? For example, this could be useful in CS3219 / CS3213 which is also a team-based project, but who don't follow the forking workflow. 

However, if we are only focusing on forking workflow projects, it would be useful!

> Have some suggestions regarding possible refactoring though(could possibly create a separate issue for this): It seems like the sub-components (i.e. IssueComponent, IssuesDeletedComponent, IssuesPostedComponent) are all identical to the ones from bug-reporting, would it be possible to just reference those components instead to reduce code duplication?

@yucongkoo I agree with this, but should this be done under a separate issue and PR as suggested by @Eclipse-Dominator?

I can't reproduce this on my laptop, perhaps this could be settled in a separate issue for the next release as it would be good to include this change in the current release since there is now less space for labels?

Would it be better to leave out the tooltips? They are not easy to understand. For repo-specific presets, the list of assignees and milestones may be too long.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0326537d-0e66-42b8-95fe-5d80892ee192)

Or perhaps having a line break may be better, although it is still quite long for repo-specific presets:

As the presets component is above the filter-bar component, this may result in a lot of unused space when the filter bar is collapsed:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7562aa4e-e9b8-420d-b3c9-49843561436e)

Only about 2/3 of the content space is used due to the blank spaces in the filter-bar and presets component. 

Maybe the filter-bar component and presets component can be placed inside a flexbox that changes flex-direction when the width falls below the breakpoint?

'''suggestion

      ``{`` this.presetsService.currentPreset.label ``}``

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

Looks good, I have added a few comments. It may also be useful to add a feature to rename presets so that users don't have to save a duplicate preset and delete the old preset every time they want to rename a preset.

Also, there are now two different types of presets: user-saved presets and preset views (currently active and contributions). Perhaps it would be good to move currently active and contributions to the new presets and save them as 2 default presets, or we can remove them entirely since users can now save their own presets. This would make it less confusing for users.

Personally this lgtm. I think it's okay if the dropdown covers other filters because the dropdown can be closed easily. I think this PR is good enough to be merged first, perhaps we can settle the position of the dropdown menu in another issue and PR?

%%[created at: 2025 Jan 20 14:51:55]%%

**Describe the bug**
When users click on the 'view current page on github' button, it opens the repository's issues page on GitHub but it applies an invalid filter.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Open a repository in WATcher
2. Click on the 'view current page on GitHub' button

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, WATcher is unable to display which PRs have been reviewed or are ready to be merged. It would be useful for users to be able to know which PRs have been reviewed by who. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
One option for this would be to display the review status and reviewer in the issue-pr-card component. However, the component is already very cluttered, especially when PRs / issues have many labels. 

Another option would be to add the ability to group by reviewers in addition to the current options of milestones and assignees. This might be useful to track the PRs that each team member has reviewed.

Or we could do both by showing just the review status (changes requested / approved / review required) in the issue-pr-card component, and include a group by reviewers option as well.

I personally think adding a group by reviewers functionality would be useful. I would love to hear more suggestions on how to display review statuses without overcrowding the UI.

I think this might be good to have as we can work on features for a future release before the current version has been released, since not everybody will be working on the current release.

> In the above scenario, both feature branches are divergent and changes made to be v1.1 will not be pulled to v1.2 (and when v1.1 eventually gets merged to main, and merged to v1.2, there might be alot of merge conflicts happening and discovered late)

Could this be mitigated by regularly merging v1.1 into v1.2?

Separating the numbers with `|` may be confusing for users as they have to remember which number refers to review count and which refers to comment count.

Maybe it would be better to show something like:

Reviews: &lt;count>
Comments: &lt;count>

in a tooltip?

Grouping by reviewers may overlap with #447 as both show PRs reviewed by each team member.

I personally think that showing the reviewers' avatars at the side does not add too much clutter. We can expand them only on mouseover and use a tooltip to show the details of the review as shown here:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b95f57e1-e988-4d0d-b0ee-4589dac7c20a)

It seems that reposense has an issue created by a deleted user:
https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/979

As a result, the author field is null, so the constructor for `GithubGraphqlIssueOrPr` ends up trying to access .login on a null object:

```
user: ``{``
    login: model.author.login
``}``,
```

and an error is thrown.

> One suggestion! - We could also consider excluding the test files from our build pipeline, if it is determined that we don't need the js files at all to run the tests. This can complement the test config, so there are two layers of checks to ensure we don''t run duplicated test files.

Thanks @gerteck for the catch! I've looked into this suggestion and excluding the `*.test.ts` files in `tsconfig.json` will indeed compliment the fix. However, there is a small issue with ESLint since it relies on `tsconfig.json` and `packages/core/tsconfig.json` to determine which files to lint. Excluding the test files in `tsconfig.json` would result in ESLint not being able to find those files, leading to errors like:

```
0:0  error  Parsing error: ESLint was configured to run on <tsconfigRootDir>/packages\core\test\unit\Page\filterIconAssets.test.ts using parserOptions.project:
- <tsconfigRootDir>/tsconfig.json
- <tsconfigRootDir>/packages\core\tsconfig.json
However, none of those TSConfigs include this file.
```

To resolve this, I've added new `tsconfig,lint.json` files for ESLint to refer to, ensuring that ESLint can still properly lint the test files while we exclude them from the build pipeline.

> so the issue is that the new address that it is now trying, which is 127.0.0.1 is not re-assigned to reflect that...I think we need to do the same for the port in the EADDRNOTAVAIL clause, which has the same problem?

Yep, that caused `openHost` for `openURL` to use the old value rather than using the default value of `127.0.0.1`. 

About the port, I think it shouldn't have the same problem (but I agree it would still be good to reassign just in case). It looks like for port, the code dynamically gets the server's port value from checking the server `address()`'s port, so the port value used will always be up to date even without reassigning:
```
    var address = server.address();
    var serveHost = address.address;
    var openHost = host;

    var serveURL = protocol + '://' + serveHost + ':' + address.port;
    var openURL = protocol + '://' + openHost + ':' + address.port;
``` 

But I'll still add in the reassignment of port just to ensure consistency and in case this isn't followed in the future

Good point about the `CAUGHT` markers! I'll add those in the next commit for changes relative to the original `live-server` file. It seems there are a few missing `CAUGHT` markers in our current patch, such as our addition of the `EADDRNOTAVAIL` check.

> The code looks more complicated than what we need for our use-case and i'm not sure if there's some restrictions such that this comment implies we only serve for ipv4?

I took a closer look at this section, which starts from line 308:
'''js
if (LiveServer.logLevel > 2 && address.address === "0.0.0.0") ``{``
  var ifaces = os.networkInterfaces();
  serveURLs = Object.keys(ifaces)
    .map(function(iface) ``{``
      return ifaces[iface];
    ``}``)
    // flatten address data, use only IPv4
    .reduce(function(data, addresses) ``{``
      addresses.filter(function(addr) ``{``
        return addr.family === "IPv4";
      ``}``).forEach(function(addr) ``{``
        data.push(addr);
      ``}``);
      return data;
    ``}``, [])
    .map(function(addr) ``{``
      return protocol + "://" + addr.address + ":" + address.port;
    ``}``);
``}``
'''

This block is some helper code for logging all available addresses when serving on `0.0.0.0`, explicitly listing the URLs users can use to access their MarkBind site. The "IPv4" comment exists because `0.0.0.0` typically only binds to IPv4 addresses, so the logging code filters out IPv6 addresses accordingly. It shouldn't have any impact on the `serve` command's ability to handle IPv6 connections. Also, I believe as of now, our codebase doesn't make use of this logging code anyways since we don't ever set our `LiveServer.logLevel` to above 2.

That said, there is a minor issue:
Since we're now supporting IPv6 addresses, we should also check for the IPv6 equivalent of `0.0.0.0`, which is `::`. Currently, when users serve on `0.0.0.0`, they receive a warning:
'''
WARNING: Using the address '0.0.0.0' could potentially expose your server to the internet, which may pose security risks.
'''
However, no such warning exists for `::`, even though it can have similar implications.

I can add that additional warning for `::` in this PR and update the logging code to also log available IPv6 addresses when users use `::`. Let me know if that sounds good!

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 18 19:55:27]%%

I updated the code here because there was an issue with IPv6 addresses. 

The original code only outputs 1 serveURL message when `serveURL !== openURL`, even if `serveURLs.length > 1` . If a developer tried logging and used an IPv6 zero address like `::0`, the serveURL would be `::0` but the openURL would be `::`. This means that even though there might be multiple addresses used, only 1 will be logged which could be misleading.

For example, before the refactor commit, if a developer set `logLevel > 2` and did `markbind s -a ::`, they would see something like:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4435b803-2f65-4ccc-bf9f-5410efbeb446)
All available addresses opened by the zero address are listed out.

But if a developer does a different command like `markbind s -a ::0`, they would instead see:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e1fec1-af46-43ab-9138-f7baecf20357)
I.e. only the address given would be listed, the other addresses opened would not be logged, even though if we check the previous example's URLs, they would work as per normal.

The refactored code just ensures the available addresses are all logged, regardless of whether `serveURL === openURL`. For example, the previous command `markbind s -a ::0` now leads to:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caf71d86-e493-40f4-84e7-c67c87da09d9)

Let me know if you'd prefer to keep the original code. If this change seems unnecessary, I'm happy to revert it.

As of now, the PR is mostly complete. The only suggestion missing is the reassignment of port. Currently, I'm having issues with figuring out how to do it.

Unlike the reassignment of `host` where we give a default value to use, we are currently relying on `.listen(0)` to give us a random available port. This port value is only available after the server completes the `.listen()` execution. One possible way to reassign right after is to use a callback during `listen()`, like:

'''js
server.listen(0, host, () => ``{``
  port = server.address().port;
``}``);
'''

However, from my own testing, this reassignment tends to come _after_ the `listening` event is emitted. This means the listener for `listening` at line 297 will still use the previous `port` value, rather than the reassigned one, defeating the purpose of this reassignment change.

If anyone is more familiar with the `http` module, `listen()` or the scheduling between the callback and the event emitting, feel free to look into this!

In theory, it's possible for that to occur. For example, for `  some text`, start = 2 would be bounded and &lt;= line.length and if `isHighlightSpaces` is true, then that means we should leave the start value as is, since we wish to use the absolute value of those bounds.

Yep, by default the indentation level is checked and accounted for and the index counting is relative to the first non-whitespace char.

To clarify, do you mean introducing something like `1[0.3]` instead of `1[0:3]` for whitespace-inclusive char-bound highlighting? If so, I think this could be a good solution that doesn't affect existing MarkBind sites and also provides new options to users. It also means we wouldn't need the special syntax anymore.

I can see a situation where the user copy-pastes in an existing chunk of code with whitespace, and non-space whitespace characters are added in directly. This may just be a documentation problem though given that this is not highly likely & usually these are converted to whitespaces in many IDEs etc, what do you think? Or is there a tweak we can do that will efficiently cover these cases?

Thanks for the feedback!

After investigating, it seems that tabs are treated as 1 "character" by the current code, leading to weird highlighting such as the following:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56f8ea2d-aa15-425c-94bf-4bad94a375d8)
For e.g., the highlight rule for line 4 is `+4[0:2]`, but rather than highlighting the first 2 characters of the indentation, it highlights the first 2 tabs as a whole.

My current idea is to see whether it's possible to convert such tabs to the corresponding number of whitespace, which should remedy the issue automatically. What do you think of this solution?

Upon initial investigations, it seems that as of the current `master` branch, tab characters are 8 spaces wide by default. I've confirmed this behavior using a simple test with @IanCheah but if anyone would like to, they can also confirm it on their own.

**Code:**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7356f0dd-9ac9-404f-9e68-8d7f30c29101)

**Code with highlighting to indicate spaces or tabs**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c705e6c-a198-4fee-9032-80475f1b9df9)

**Actual output:**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe50ea12-9cca-4d1f-9cd4-b74c26056ce2)

If the consensus is that tabs should instead be 4 spaces wide instead of 8, this PR will also target this issue with its auto-conversion of tabs to 4 spaces wide. The UG has also been updated to indicate this change. However, it is possible that existing MarkBind sites that use tabs in their fenced code will be affected by this change, since visually the tabs will be cut in half.

To avoid breaking existing sites, we could also choose to retain the 8 space wide tabs for backward compatibility. What does everyone think?

I'm not familiar with this part of the codebase but is it possible for the following case to occur for a node:
- `node.name === 'pre'` is True
- the node has some child with `name === 'code'`
- `!doesFunctionBtnContainerExistInNode(node)` is False
- `isFunctionBtnContainer(node)` is True

If it's possible, there might be a slight issue. In the old code, this scenario will result in:
1. The `if` condition is False, so it moves on to the `else-if`
2. The `else-if` condition is True, so it continues with `cheerio(node).append(getButtonHTML());`

However, in the new code, the same scenario will instead:
1. The `if` condition is True, so it moves on into the inner code
2. The inner `if` condition is False, so it doesn't continue
3. The `else-if` condition is never checked since the `if` condition already passed.

The new code would result in `cheerio(node).append(getButtonHTML());` not being executed, while it would have been executed by the old code. Will this be a possible issue? Or is such a scenario impossible to begin with?

Actually, another way to allow for errors to users and warnings to developers is to detect 'process.env.TEST_MODE' and log accordingly.

Would this solution be better to keep the urgency of errors for users and hide these intended errors from developers during testing? 

'''
    if (process.env.TEST_MODE) ``{``
      logger.warn(error);
    ``}`` else ``{``
      logger.error('$``{``error.message``}``
      File: $``{``context.cwf``}``
      URL provided: $``{``node.attribs.src``}``
      
      Please check the \'src\' attribute in the popover element.
      Ensure it doesn't contain a URL (e.g., "http://www.example.com").');
    ``}``

Would it be better to instead log it as a success during TEST MODE? So we leave it as an error for both users and developers, but only during a test run do we adjust it to show something like "Success: invalid case of URL in popover element caught". This way, both users and developers will be aware of any issues since its still an error for them but testing will become less misleading. This fix can also be applied to the other error messages in `includePanelProcessor.ts`

For users and developers:

I looked into `NodeProcessor.test.ts` and there they use a jest mock and spy of the `logger.warn` to check that its been called with a specific message. A similar implementation could be brought in to `includePanelProcessor.test.ts` to "hide" the core library's error messages being logged as mentioned in #2612.

For example, in `includePanelProcessor.test.ts` around line 286 we could add a spy on logger.error with something like this:
'''ts
  const nodeProcessor = getNewDefaultNodeProcessor();
  const loggerErrorSpy = jest.spyOn(logger, 'error').mockImplementation(() => ``{````}``);
  const result = await nodeProcessor.process(indexPath, index);

  const expected = [
    '&lt;h1 id="index">Index&lt;/h1>',
    `&lt;div style="color: red">&lt;div style="color: red">$``{``expectedErrorMessage``}``&lt;/div>&lt;/div>`,
  ].join('\n');

  expect(result).toEqual(expected);
  expect(loggerErrorSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(new Error(expectedErrorMessage));
  loggerErrorSpy.mockRestore();
'''
> The log is valid and intentional, it is printed because we intentionally used erroneous syntax. The fact that the log is printed is an assertion that the error is indeed detected.

I think if we do it this way, we not only get to hide the error during testing which avoids confusion for developers but still also assert that the error has been detected and printed properly.

If we wish to still log the error to the console like in the CLI's case, we could also just choose to avoid a mock implementation but still check for the error message.

What do you think?

There is some weird behavior with the searchbar of the card stack. It seems to only search using the last word in the search bar. For example, consider this sequence of searches:
1. Basic
2. Basic card
3. Basic card question

The expected behavior depends on whether the searchbar should be an OR or an AND search but either way, the actual behavior doesn't seem to follow either. The actual behavior seems to be that the searchbar only uses the last word, so for 1, 2 and 3, it searches "basic", "card" and "question" respectively. Is this intended behavior?

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

When IPv6 addresses are provided for the `serve` command, the URL opened for live preview is an invalid one. This often leads to an error pop-up, which may mislead users to believe that the address they provided was invalid. In reality, it was the live preview URL that was invalid.

For example, `markbind serve -a ::1` will attempt to launch the URL "http://::1:8080". The proper URL for this address is actually "http://[::1]:8080/", i.e. the IPv6 address is enclosed in square brackets.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1a36758-c1ff-405c-847a-25a022df4514)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebcb7e2b-3f7d-470c-8d75-e8ec7fac31d0)

There's currently a workaround which is to add the square brackets within the `serve` command, however this is unintuitive for users.

### Expected behavior

When an IPv6 address is specified, the URL launched for live preview automatically appends the square brackets, leading to a valid link.

For example, the command `markbind serve -a ::1` should lead to the following page:

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

When an unavailable address is given for the `serve` command, the user is informed and is told that MarkBind will try another address. However, the URL opened still uses the original unavailable address, leading the user to the wrong URL for their MarkBind site. This could lead to confusion for the user who might suspect their site has failed to load.

For example:
`markbind serve -a 1.1.1.1` will lead to the following messages from MarkBind
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b5de37-47e2-4589-9c38-0273233e84cc)

However, despite serving on "http://127.0.0.1:8080", the URL opened is still "http://1.1.1.1:8080". Also, going to the actual URL will load the MarkBind site, so the actual site is properly loaded, it's just that the URL opened is wrong.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f49e67a7-3224-48b6-8cfe-c14a5108740a)

### Expected behavior

When an unavailable address is given, the user is informed and the URL opened correctly matches the one in which the MarkBind site is served. 

Using the previous example, the URL opened should be http://127.0.0.1:8080, leading to the user's MarkBind site.

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

In the core package, all code -- including test cases -- is primarily written in TypeScript and later converted to JavaScript. This setup allows us to implement an easy fix for #2629 by running only TypeScript test files (`*.test.ts`) to avoid duplicate test execution.

However, one test file `packages\core\test\unit\Page\filterIconAssets.test.js`, is currently missing a corresponding TypeScript version. To accommodate this exception, we currently need to hardcode it in the fix for #2629, which isn't ideal.

Migrating this file to TypeScript will:
- Improve code consistency and maintainability, aligning it with the rest of the core package.
- Remove the need for a hardcoded exception in the fix for #2629.

Currently, test cases are implemented for only a few of MarkBind's CLI commands: `init` and `build`. However, other commands such as `serve` and `deploy` lack dedicated test cases, which leaves gaps in our test coverage.

Adding test cases for these commands will:
- Improve test coverage for the CLI
- Improve code stability by detecting potential regressions
- Enhance DevOps workflows, making it easier to catch issues during development and deployment

Filling in these gaps will also make the codebase more maintainable and help prevent future bugs or overlooked edge cases.

Currently, there's a warning for the user when they try to serve on address `0.0.0.0`. However, when the IPv6 zero address (`::`) is used there is no such warning, even though it would have the same security risks.

For e.g.:
- `markbind s -a 0.0.0.0` would result in the following warning:
   `WARNING: Using the address '0.0.0.0' could potentially expose your server to the internet, which may pose security risks. Proceed with caution? [y/N]`
- `markbind s -a ::` would not result in any warning at all, even though it also exposes the server to the internet.

The issue lies with the following code:
'''js
function isIPAddressZero(address) ``{``
  const patternForZero = /&hat;0(\.0)*$/;

  return patternForZero.test(address);
``}``
'''

There is currently no regex/check for IPv6's zero address, that's why the warning doesn't appear.

### Expected behavior

When users try to serve on the IPv6 zero address, they should be appropriately warned about the security risks involved, similar to how we do it for `0.0.0.0`.

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

As discussed in PR #2656 with @tlylt and @lhw-1, it is possible to get false positive from the code coverage report generated by Codecov after merging a PR to `master` (see commit d1ba064 in `master` branch or the [Codecov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/MarkBind/markbind/commit/d1ba06439c4d94c15c20ec97db13cc32c53b7542) for an example of a false positive). Currently, this false positive scenario is not mentioned in the developer docs but will be updated in PR #2659.

There is currently no strict requirement to maintain code coverage before merging PRs. Instead, the Codecov report is meant to be used during PR review to evaluate if the PR severely degrades the coverage.

However, the Codecov report doesn't seem to be working reliably in the PRs, where they stop reporting the status for some PRs. For e.g. in PR #2656, the following error occurs during CI:
```
[2025-03-20T12:23:00.740Z] ['info'] Pinging Codecov: https://codecov.io/upload/v4?package=github-action-3.1.6-uploader-0.8.0&token=*******&branch=serve-codecov-hotfix&build=13969151105&build_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMarkBind%2Fmarkbind%2Factions%2Fruns%2F13969151105&commit=d63ce9f4dc7cdd74673506b9ae88ae525639362d&job=CI&pr=2656&service=github-actions&slug=MarkBind%2Fmarkbind&name=&tag=&flags=&parent=

Please upload with the Codecov repository upload token to resolve issue. Expected time to availability: 1549s."``}``
```

This error is preventing our ability to properly review PRs and their code coverage changes. As discovered by @tlylt, it seems that raising the PR from a fork leads to a more serious rate limit on the Codecov tokens, leading to the error. (Reference: https://github.com/codecov/feedback/issues/301)

The suggestion mentioned in the issue is something like our dual workflow that we have documented in https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind-action/tree/master/.github/workflows#usage for security reason, which might need some effort to understand and implement.

Let's take a closer look at Codecov to see how to reliably generate the report for each PR.

### Expected behavior

Codecov bot reliably generates a Codecov report for each PR every CI run. This will allow PR reviewers to properly analyze the code coverage changes introduced by the PR and highlight any serious degradation.

Migrating to Codecov v5 might resolve this issue. According to their [release notes](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/releases/tag/v5.0.0): 
> The `v5` release also coincides with the opt-out feature for tokens for public repositories. In the `Global Upload Token` section of the settings page of an organization in codecov.io, you can set the ability for Codecov to receive a coverage reports from any source. This will allow contributors or other members of a repository to upload without needing access to the Codecov token. For more details see [how to upload without a token](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-tokens#uploading-without-a-token).

If we enable this setting, PRs from forks should no longer be impacted by the rate limits on Codecov tokens, allowing code coverage reports to be generated reliably. Would this be a viable solution for us?

I don't think you'll need to adjust the codecov setting since PRs from forks are considered unprotected branches, which fits the condition for tokenless upload. But we can still adjust the setting just to be safe.

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

When visiting a page with KaTeX text, inspecting the console reveals that MarkBind is having trouble getting the fonts for the KaTeX.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b0134e7-4b91-4ba8-a5ec-da5a14c2055a)

This issue has a somewhat notable effect on the text. From my own personal testing, here is how the following code looks with and without the font
```
\begin``{``equation``}``
  a&hat;2+b&hat;2=c&hat;2
\end``{``equation``}``

\begin``{``equation``}``
  \begin``{``pmatrix``}``
    A & B \\ B & C
  \end``{``pmatrix``}``
  \textit``{``Test``}``
\end``{``equation``}``

\begin``{``equation``}``
E = mc&hat;2, \quad a&hat;2 + b&hat;2 = c&hat;2, \quad \sum_``{``n=1``}``&hat;``{``\infty``}`` \frac``{``1``}````{``n&hat;2``}`` = \frac``{``\pi&hat;2``}````{``6``}``
\end``{``equation``}``

\begin``{``equation``}``
f(x) = ax&hat;2 + bx + c
\end``{``equation``}``
```

Notice the difference in the matrix and Sigma, as well as some minor differences in the other text and notation.

### Possible Reason

After some investigation, it seems that the issue is most likely during the build process. When a user does `serve` or `build`, the `fonts` folder that holds the KaTeX fonts is placed inside the `css` folder, i.e. `_site\markbind\css\fonts`. 

The file `markbind.min.css` is attempting to access the fonts but is using the wrong relative path to it. That is because within our own `core-web` package, the original path was `packages\core-web\dist\css\markbind.min.css` and the path to the fonts folder was `packages\core-web\dist\fonts`. Because of this, `markbind.min.css` references the fonts using the path `../font_name`


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd190d1-7226-451a-8fdd-6df72fe2fbe9)

This means that after the site is built, rather than accessing the font folder properly, `markbind.min.css` is trying to access `_site\markbind\fonts\font_name`, which doesn't exist. This leads to the errors we see in the console. Manually moving the fonts folder out to `_site\markbind` and reloading the page seems to fix the issue.

### Expected behavior

The KaTeX files should be loaded in properly without any issues, resulting in the correct looking text font used for KaTeX notation.

If what I've identified is the actual root cause, then we only need to make sure that the relative path referenced by `markbind.min.css` is correctly set for the fonts. This is either done by adjusting our own `core-web` package or by adjusting the `fonts` folder for the built site.

Popover error messages seem to either appear at the location of the popover or at the end of the page. This leads to some inconsistencies which may be confusing to users.

For example:
'''md
&lt;popover header="From a HTML file" src="">
  This is loaded from a .html file
&lt;/popover>

Test content

123

'''

But
'''md
&lt;popover header="From a HTML file" src="http">
  This is loaded from a .html file
&lt;/popover>

Test content

generates the error at the location of the popover
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa18bf19-e015-465c-9613-a7d37f10be24)

### Expected behavior

The popover error message location should be standardized. Personally, I think having it appear where the popover should have been is most intuitive to users (i.e. the second example)

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

`<include>` and `<popover>` have CyclicReference detection to prevent infinite looping/rendering of components. However, this doesn't seem to work as intended. 

For example the following code:
```
<popover src="index.md">
Test
</popover>
```
Will result in the following site:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f4befda-1464-4622-a127-1c36c5feb45e)
i.e, the popover shows the site with the popover which also renders itself again and again, resulting in increasingly more popovers

Eventually, after creating enough popovers, it _does_ render the error:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2edb9056-8aa2-4fcd-ba2c-1269435f719d)

A similar result can be seen with `<include>`:
```
Test
<include src="index.md"/>
```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698cb670-8d2b-42e5-a51f-56541842e255)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fbbaf2-cd28-4055-9a24-1b3497dd6fc5)

### Expected behavior

The CyclicReference error should immediately replace the `<include>` or `<popover>` element rather than rendering it a few times and then rendering the error div.

For example, we should see something like this for the 2 examples above:
Popover element is not rendered at all, error div is shown instead
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46aafe1a-c6e1-42f4-8edc-6518ee0cfbeb)

Include element is not rendered, error div is shown instead. Other elements, like the "Test", are left alone.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31886257-a951-4ff3-944e-347fa1c80ee9)

This would make it very apparent to users that there is a cyclic reference issue and where it is in the site.

### What is the area that this feature belongs to?

Reader Usability

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

**Current behavior:**
When a reader clicks a footnote link, the page scrolls down to the corresponding footnote content at the bottom of the page. However, there is no link to take the reader back to where that footnote was mentioned in the main text.

**Why this is an issue:**
- Readers may not realize they can use their browser's back button to return to the reference since it may not be obvious or intuitive
- It's also difficult for readers to locate where a particular footnote is reference if they're browsing the footnotes directly. For example, it's not easy for readers to tell where the 4th footnote ("Math") was mentioned without scrolling through or using `ctrl-F`:
  
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/014f2485-c989-4e9f-befc-f2c2dfea82b1)

### Describe the solution you'd like

Add a "back to reference" link, e.g. `↩`, next to each footnote at the bottom of the page. This link would scroll the reader back to the original spot in the page where that footnote was referenced.

An example we could follow is GFMD's footnotes:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9f28b08-dcff-4b35-b4bb-760f4248af76)

This would improve navigation and make the reading experience smoother and more intuitive, especially for long reference-heavy documents that MarkBind caters to.

> Otherwise, is the test actually failing in some segment, but reported as pass?
    - I suspect this might be the case for cli tests, hopefully not.

After some investigation, the error during CLI testing appears to be intentional. Firstly, the error message comes from the implementation of the `src` attribute for popover elements. This behavior was introduced in PR #1780. The purpose of the error was to prevent URLs like "https://www.google.com/" from being used in the `src` attribute.

The specific test code triggering the error is as follows:
```
<popover header="URLs are not valid" src="http://www.shouldnotwork.com">
  URLs should not be valid
</popover>
```

This popover deliberately triggers the error and the snapshot test expects the popover's HTML content to be replaced with an error message like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c99dd13-2161-4940-9786-88ffa5d70875)


I do agree that the error is misleading though. The CLI tests do not verify if the error is properly logged, so perhaps we can switch from logging this as an error to logging it as a warning instead. 

Users will still be notified and developers can ignore the warnings during testing. A PR could also be created to improve the error message since the current one is not user-friendly anyways.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dad0e514-79f9-4512-88a4-a6cbde325fd8)


EDIT:
I've made another suggestion for a fix in PR #2639 that logs the error as a warning for developers during testing but logs it as an error for users.

I haven't looked into the core package tests yet but I suspect the errors (at least those in the screenshots) are also from the same file and a similar fix can be applied to them as well.

Looking into the console, it seems that there's an issue with `this.$refs.header` being undefined
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97b1c076-0509-4eb4-ad82-c6fbe2a36710)

It could possibly be due to how Vue 2 and Vue 3 renders Tabs within Panels differently or how/when refs are computed. According to [Vue 3 docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs), it's mentioned:
> Note that you can only access the ref **after the component is mounted.**

Within `Tab.vue` and `TabGroup.vue`, I've tried moving `headerRendered()` from `computed` to under `mounted()` as `this.headerRendered = this.$refs.header.innerHTML`. This fix seems to work as of the current master branch.

yep! I think the issue is that the [`&lt;span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) can only contain permitted [phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#phrasing_content) (text and markup only), so when the web browser receives the rendered HTML it does some reordering of some sort to reorder the invalid HTML into something valid which in turn causes the mismatch between rendered DOM and received HTML. 

I also just pushed the update to the snapshot files (to account for `&lt;span>` removal) and the unit test (removed check for v-dataTable Vue directive) for the DataTables. Testing for `dt-processed` in the unit tests and rendering of dataTables might be more complex as that requires integration testing with the dataTable js file.

Thanks @Tim-Siu for your speedy reply!!

Thank you for raising this up!

> node.name === 'pre' is True

!doesFunctionBtnContainerExistInNode(node) is False

This scenario wouldn't occur because if the node is a `&lt;pre/>`  element, it shouldn't be a functionButtonContainer. 

This is because

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/88016577d25a4b9a555d37a23ceeb5edcd44cc4a/packages/core/src/plugins/codeBlockButtonsAssets/codeBlockButtonsContainer.ts#L1-L14

The function button container is a `div` element (i.e. node.name == div).

Though I think it could use further refactoring to make it clearer as well and group the logic together, e.g. to shift the logic together into the plugin ts, even if it risks some duplication.

To set some context - from what I understand in differences between `createApp()` and `createSSRApp()` is whether the app runs in `hydration mode` when first mounted. Reference: [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr.html#rendering-an-app)
> To make the client-side app interactive, Vue needs to perform the hydration step. During hydration, it creates the same Vue application that was run on the server, matches each component to the DOM nodes it should control, and attaches DOM event listeners.
> To mount an app in hydration mode, we need to use [createSSRApp()](https://vuejs.org/api/application#createssrapp) instead of createApp():

This code snippet is run client side - `index.js` is the entry point for the markbind binary that is bundled in `core-web`. Since it is clientSide - definitely should be using `CreateSSRApp()` - as the client is also served the `*.html` that was pre-rendered, and we want the client to do hydration and check differences betweeen served `html` and DOM structure given by the render function. 

* Client is referring to the web browser serving the page

--- 

A related question is whether we should be calling `createApp()` or `createSSRApp()` when we render the `html` in the server. (that is to be sent to client). Referring to this portion in `PageVueServerRenderer`:

https://github.com/gerteck/markbind/blob/7ea3d6d544e7b0d3b69333f2d88279d793d67da5/packages/core/src/Page/PageVueServerRenderer.ts#L88-L103

Theoretically, it should be fine to use `createApp()` on server to render HTML since there's no hydration involved, but I couldn't find any information on this. Following the [serverRenderer (renderToString) npm usage docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/server-renderer), it seems that `renderToString` is supposed to be used with `createSSRApp()` so there is that.

Currently investigating this issue, and I can't seem to figure out the hydration error exists yet as well.

Because of how `Quiz` and `Question` both check if `questions` is defined or undefined to check if the question is in a quiz, the change to default `questions` to `[]` breaks some logic in the question component, so it can't be used.

After some investigation, it seems to be a known issue with `transition-group`? https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/ 6715 

They seem to have patched it - perhaps updating vue version will fix it. However, .... ( I didn't update the vue version to the latest because of some errors with typescript... which is a whole rabbit hole)

I tried that too but unfortunately I realized its quite coupled (q a bit of logic depends on question being defined or undefined)

(&hat; here, the question immediately gets pushed into the array if the array is defined so the length would not be 0)

Also I don't think it hits at the core of the issue of the hydration error, so refactoring might not fix the hydration error - though I think refactoring would definitely not be bad, but maybe expand the PR scope too much

To set the context, In the current logic, the only way for the `questions` array to be defined is if the quiz was a parent component and initialized the questions array. So the quiz being undefined is used in the logic to check whether it was in a quiz or not.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306cb047-15f1-49ca-ab58-020d6f72bdc4)

To elaborate specifically why, the quiz would `provide` a defined array [], so if our `injected` question was defined, it must mean that the question is in a parent quiz component.

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/ea7cf57e067f0880d470265fad2fae8a0d3eaa24/packages/vue-components/src/questions/Quiz.vue#L116-L130

This affects the logic in the snippet in previous comment. If we define the default value of the questions array to be a defined, but empty array. The question is pushed into the `questions` array (through [provide/inject](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject) by Quiz), because it thinks it is a parent Quiz component.  At the same time, it hides the question** as well. (To be shown by the quiz component as per quiz logic later)

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/ea7cf57e067f0880d470265fad2fae8a0d3eaa24/packages/vue-components/src/questions/QuizQuestionMixin.js#L44-L49

'''js
 created() ``{`` 
   if (this.questions) ``{``               // thinks it is in a quiz
     this.active = false;              // hides the question
     this.questions.push(this);   // adds this question in the array
   ``}`` 
 ``}``, 
'''

This raises some issues because some methods in `question.vue` uses the property of whether `questions` is defined to determine if it is in the quiz. I think it could be refactored to make it more clear and have proper methods as this is logical dependency is not so clear at first (or second) glance.

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/ea7cf57e067f0880d470265fad2fae8a0d3eaa24/packages/vue-components/src/questions/Question.vue#L150-L163

However, a more relevant issue is that I don't think it resolves the hydration issue. I noted that the reason why the hydration error doesn't show up is because if we set `questions:` `default: []`, as per the logic in `created()` above is because it hides the question. `active=false`. Specifically this causes the whole question to not render (`v-if=active`):

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/ea7cf57e067f0880d470265fad2fae8a0d3eaa24/packages/vue-components/src/questions/Question.vue#L1-L3

 But actually if we set it back to `active=true` actually the hydration error still persists even if `questions` array is defined..

Thank you for your help on this PR! I also noted that [popovers](https://deploy-preview-2622--markbind-master.netlify.app/userguide/components/popups#popovers) also lost their spacing:

![Picture1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d89473dd-5c3f-4c6d-a77c-6d326f6e525e)

It's could be because the vue component libraries were updated or some differences in the configuration syntax, since I made minimal changes enough just to satisfy any errors and warnings.

After investigation, I have found that this is because of whitespace preservation in the rendering of the HTML.

```
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Popover on top</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Popover on top</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">Popover on top</button>
```
The gaps between each button is a result of the newline being parsed as whitespace between each button. However, Vue 3 automatically condenses and removes this whitespace, causing the resulting removal of the gap.

```
app.config.compilerOptions.whitespace = 'preserve';
```

This will be added during the rendering process on server side to restore previous Vue 2 default behavior.

* Identified issue dropdown submenus do not disappear due to [breaking change in Vue 3](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/children): The $children instance property has been removed from Vue 3.0 and is no longer supported.
* This caused the current logic that hides submenus at the same level to break, as it was reliant on the `$children` property to do so.
* I have made a non-trivial change, to maintain the logic to hide other submenu instances at the same level, by shifting from the use of `$children` to maintaining a list of submenus at each level using `provide/inject` to resolve this issue.

> * The tree diagram functionality is no longer working:

I have looked into the tree diagram functionality: The root cause is due to changing of default handling of whitespaces from Vue 2 to Vue 3, specifically: [https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-compileroptions-whitespace](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-compileroptions-whitespace)
* default in Vue 2 is to preserve, changed to condense in Vue 3.

A few ways we can approach this to resolve the issue.
* set default option to `preserve` for the Vue app in render function generation, rendering and mounting
* transform tree element to `&lt;pre class="tree"/>`, as `&lt;pre/>` use case is to preserve all whitespaces
* do both.

Will investigate modal opening animation soon alongside that of quiz button animation

I think regarding the Question hydration error - I can revert the changes and let the hydration warning lapse for now.

An alternative could be to find a workaround to avoid this, though not sure how feasible nor if worth it.

Upon investigation, it could be a internal vue issue during rendering - See vue/6715 (https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/ 6715). This seems to be patched in a later vue version (after v3.3.11).  We can choose to update Vue to latest version in future. (Currently using v3.3.11). 
* I faced issues upgrading beyond Vue3.3, (typescript versioning/dependency hell/typing library issue or something else. previously tried to resolve this issue, couldn't make enough headway as scope expanded beyond comprehensible in a single PR w Vue migration, not too trivial to debug.)
* Hence -  Either revert changes to questions, let hydration warning lapse for now. (minor warning), or I can disable animations for now.
* We can raise an issue to update the vue version (to maybe Vue 3.5) as well as typescript errors and set it to higher priority, which should resolve the error, and then re-add the animation.

Edit: I have disabled question button animations to resolve the hydration warnings.

> Tried serving the markbind docs locally with this branch and got this warning (Skipped rendering unsafe attribute name)

I couldn't find a way to disable the warnings for server-renderer meaningfully. However, the warning does point out a legitimate issue though — the HTML generated by the All Contributors bot has unescaped quotes in the alt attribute:
```
<img src="URL" width="100px;" alt="Shuyao "Tim" Xu"/>
```
The issue is occuring because the inner quotes around are not escaped (i.e., should be `&quot;`). Causing the html to be recognised as `alt = "Shuyao "` and `Tim` and `Xu"`. The error in the code isn't generated by vue renderer, but rather the all-contributors bot. 

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/ea7cf57e067f0880d470265fad2fae8a0d3eaa24/docs/about.md?plain=1#L133


Since this is an edge case, maybe instead we can open a small PR to manually escape the quotes in about.md (i.e., alt="Shuyao `&quot;`Tim`&quot;` Xu"). Also, maybe file a PR or issue upstream with the All Contributors project to raise concern on handling alt attributes with quotes.

I am investigating the changes in mobile accessibility styling - it looks to be caused by `markbind.min.css` not loading in, either not being bundled or not being accessed properly. Trying to find out what has caused this regression and how to revert it.

The Navbar content not being handled properly is because of changes to CSS selectors for Vue scoped styles:
* https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0023-scoped-styles-changes.md
* I have updated the styling to fix this.

I have investigated and identified the cause of regression for site-nav and page-nav whitespace. 

This was due to a change in `portal-vue` rendering mechanism, specifically [portal-target no longer rendering a root element](https://portal-vue.linusb.org/guide/migration.html#portaltarget-component)
* A high-level explanation - Due to this expectation, the style attribute accounting for the `--sticky-header-height` was applied twice, causing this whitespace.
* Fix: applied a parent div to `portal-target` to 'absorb' this styling to maintain the expectation as per `vue-portal` v2. I have also done a rough check for other components that use portal-vue if such fix is required, but not needed as their styling is not affected as per a preliminary check.

* We can consider refactoring this in the future.  However, note that the change to refactor is not too trivial and requires some significant understanding of current styling in `main.css`, with regards to `#page-nav` and `#site-nav`, and how it interacts with `Overlay`, `OverlaySource`, and `portal-vue`.

Just Pushed a fix for the `closeable` directive.

I initially updated the directive's `bind()` hook to `beforeMount()` based on the [official Vue migration guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/custom-directives.html). However, this change caused the directive to stop working correctly — since the DOM mutations need to happen after the element is mounted.

I've now fixed this by updating the hook from beforeMount() to mounted(), ensuring all DOM manipulations and event bindings happen after the element is fully available in the DOM.

The `closeable` directive works now: https://deploy-preview-2622--markbind-master.netlify.app/userguide/reusingcontents#allowing-users-to-remove-some-contents

For anyone who wants to understand the latest commit (and preceeding commit):

![pic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd62ae38-6174-4716-b323-4d68237aebb3)

The pictures did not resize and defaulted to max size was because the method to set height and width was not firing, which were set to fire on `load` event. It did not fire on Vue 3 hydration, but did so for Vue 2.

The reason the load event fired in Vue 2 but not in Vue 3 is likely due to a difference in hydration behavior between Vue 2 and Vue 3 during SSR (Server-Side Rendering). In short, it seems like:
* Vue 2: load event fired after hydration of DOM.
* Vue 3: likely the onload event is fired before Vue runs and hydrates the DOM.

This seems to be a somewhat known (?) issue through search.

It could be that that when the component is hydrated in Vue 3, the image is already in the DOM and is marked as loaded and not fire `load` event for performance reasons. Or that Vue 2 retriggers the load event etc. I don’t know the exact reason.

[Load Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event)

What I’ve done is to add a `mounted` routine to run the height and width calculation and setting if the image is already loaded, to be sure that it runs in any case.

This `@load` listener is also used in `Annotate`, `Thumbnail`, so I will check it and push changes if needed as well
Thumbnail also visibly has this issue (sizing inside the thumbnail):  
* Left is Vue 3, Right is Vue 2 (has since been updated to be as per right image).
* The thumbnail is not resizing to fit the size attribute, also because `load` is not being fired.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99c72f5-d4ca-4afe-99ce-497ac47a09d5)

Thumbnails now fixed:

Sizing of pics also now fixed:

> Hi @gerteck, I have noticed a little differences under Admin Info/Ip/Week2.

Thanks @IanCheah for your help! I will have to investigate the tabs issue. 

Regarding the mermaid rendering, it seems related to CORS and seems to be quite flaky, it could have been a regression, or rather, side effect from my previous PR (#2614) shifting mermaid to load on demand for efficiency. I can only replicate the issue sometimes. It seems that some investigate on that is due as well, though I suppose if we support offline loading (#2548) and bundle it together it should totally resolve the issue - since it is likely due to CORS.

Sometimes it works:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e54e4e5-10d8-45d2-89f6-3f02e7cbdc36)

But I also encountered when I had the CORS issue as well. But the flakyness would definitely explain why it was not spotted earlier. Could be issue on mermaid CDN (header issue, CORS)?


I think we should postpone this issue till after the migration, and set up a separate issue to tackle this? Otherwise, any more commits will continue to balloon this PR. What do you think?

This is such active devs may work on it in parallel, and if there are any breaking functionalities that we have not found, the previous markbind version can be used to generate existing websites.

Thanks for your input! Will need your help to test and review it! @Tim-Siu.

I didn't even realize that it also renders any static mermaid diagrams added by the user which was previously missed out! 

I just thought about it again. Actually, should we just do away with using Vue here and remove coupling to Vue? I realized that it might be over engineered, might not even need to use vue directive. Might be good to follow KISS.

*  directly use mermaid.js to render 'mermaid' elements? (wouldn't need to attach it to window object). The [default built-in behaviour](https://mermaid.js.org/config/usage.html#using-mermaid-run) is such that mermaid just renders all elements with 'class="mermaid"' automatically.
* use  '&lt;pre class="mermaid"> XXX &lt;/pre>' format for transformation. '&lt;pre>' HTML element is the [standard](https://mermaid.js.org/config/usage.html#installing-and-hosting-mermaid-on-a-webpage) usage for mermaid on their website, and as a bonus, that flash before rendering also preserves the original textual presentation of the mermaid diagram. I think it looks better too. It also better aligns if users want to directly use that in their markdown file. 
* Similar logic, conditionally import mermaid only if mermaid elements are found. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f778416-26bc-4b08-bf0d-b7c06c6dc8e9)

Can take a look! Just pushed the simplification.

Oh, I did not realize that it would not work inside vue components, especially those that are dynamically retrieved. I see what you mean. Will do the testing as required and make the relevant changes.

* Turns out, the GANTT diagram does not render properly if the mermaid syntax is wrapped with `&lt;pre/>`, so better not to use that. 
* The weird placement of the diagrams was due to forcing the rerender through Vue, have fixed the logic.

Edit: We can use a MutationObserver to watch for new mermaid diagrams that are dynamically retrieved, without relying on Vue, as a viable option.

I have shifted back the approach of this PR to use MutationObservers, as similarly taken by #2626 

I have temporarily updated the `&lt;pre/>` css to demonstrate that the gantt diagram now spans the full size as intended.
I have also temporarily updated the bug from codeBlockButton plugins so that the documentation will render correct with usage of  `&lt;pre/>`.

#### To test:
> cd .\packages\cli\test\functional\test_site\
markbind serve -d
go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/test_site/testMermaid.html (or any other local host port used)
Verify mermaid diagrams shown are ok 

Additionally, I have no longer manually added processed class attribute for mermaid as it does this on its own by adding a `data-processed="true"`.

We can wait for #2625 to be merged to fix the side effect of `&lt;pre/>` styling before we further review and update this.

I think that the coupling in the tests for `test_site` and mermaid should be separated. 

I think that a change in the script for mermaid should not have to cause a change in 4.5K unrelated LoC (of snapshot tests). Let's instead create a separate `test_site` for the mermaid plugin (e.g. `test_site_plugin_mermaid`), like how it is done for the `dataTable` plugin, and adopt this approach moving forward for future plugins, or tests. 

We can address this general _refactoring_ work (organization of tests, test sites, and possibly naming of test_sites) in a separate issue and PR.

> As mentioned during the group discussion, [SICP JS](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/sicpjs/3.2.1) in Source Academy handles this problem by putting both search functions side-by-side. By this train of thought, it might be worthwhile to make both of the search functions into modular components.

Thank you for the insights! Completely agree with the further considerations for the feature addition. I think it relates with @2529 and there will be a need for further analysis of the cost and benefit of making certain plugins default and increasing the usability/visibility of the features of each plugin. 

The integration of both search functions as modular components could also be new issues to investigate and discuss!

Will work on adding documentation for the plugin after further discussion and confirmation on the feature 👍

After discussion last week, I realized that if we can get a fully functional search bar that does a full text search, it would probably be a better idea to just do away with the index/header search, since it was a placeholder from the start.

I found an interesting adaption of Pagefind in a very similar fashion to Algolia, see here
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitepress-plugin-pagefind?activeTab=readme
* https://vue-command-palette.robertshaw.id/ 

Using the vue command palette package, it would not be too hard to recreate the algolia UI [sample implementation here](https://sugarat.top/) (open source chinese blog, can do ctrl + k to open command palette, search "test") and effectively replace the current search bar with that. 

However, the issue is that these packages are all in Vue 3 making it incompatible with the current Vue2 library. I think it may be time to tackle the Vue 2 -&gt; Vue 3 migration for greater longevity of the current components and future new components if developed

Sorry, would something like

`1[_:4]` where `_` replaces the digit if we want to include the whitespace? Not sure if it will complicate things, but it seems most intuitive to me, since it relates to the start of the highlight / line, without adding anything extra in the syntax, given it would be left empty.

Looking at the use case of highlighting, it seems that the reason why this feature was developed this way was because of the usecase of highlighting code blocks, which are appropriately indented. (Given that the documentation is under the [code formatting](https://markbind.org/userGuide/formattingContents.html#line-highlighting) section).

Regarding the Node LTS Error, it has already been removed, and it is viewable on the latest documentation linked in the repository readme.

> The MarkBind website for the current MarkBind release is at https://markbind.org/.
The website for the latest master branch (not yet released to the public) is at https://markbind-master.netlify.app/.

The last time the MarkBind website was updated was on the date of the latest MarkBind release, so there is a difference between the two, although I should have edited the relevant portion in the user guide with the PR that fixed the issue.

For guidance on how to install npm / node, maybe you could explore the use of a expandable panel, since it would be optional (but good to know) information

Is there any purpose behind the rephrasing of the instructions? Seems slightly unnecessary

Reference Documentation Site in Question: [https://markbind.org/userGuide/templates.html](https://markbind.org/userGuide/templates.html)

Something doesn't seem right... The buttons represent `deploy to Netlify links`, not sample sites of the templates. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/566bcaa4-78cd-49ba-bfef-8edd45a43401)

These are actually quick deploy links provided by MarkBind, that create a repository for you and deploy in a single click.
* https://github.com/MarkBind/init-typical-netlify
* https://github.com/MarkBind/init-minimal-netlify

In fact, this highlights that the `project` template `netlify-deploy` button is also wrongly labelled.
It was probably overlooked in #2400 because a great deal of effort was spent in the design of the site, such that the documentation was wrongly labelled. 

Also the site [https://markbind-template-portfolio.netlify.app/](https://markbind-template-portfolio.netlify.app/) looks broken on my end too. (Needs to be investigated).

**I have a few suggestions:**
- Add maybe a separate column as 'sample site' or 'example site' for each template.
 - Consider adding this for default and minimal as well.

- Fix the `project` template `quick deploy` link, because it's not a quick deploy link. Instead, maybe put it under sample site or related, as it's quite helpful.

- Fix and simplify the portfolio template, right now it seems a bit convoluted (and also seems broken). As discussed in our last meeting, it could be beneficial to simplify and even target certain audiences (i. e. cs2103t / cs2113 students) since they have a touchpoint with markbind and are probably the most likely to be new users. This could mean adding a sample tP project, and maybe an orbital section as well. 


These suggestions could be made out into separate issues as well to be appropriate handled and tracked.

Cheers 👍

https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/rendering-mechanism#templates-vs-render-functions

Considering use of templates instead of render functions as templates are simpler, and still conduct SSR. No pressing need to compile render functions from [@vue/compiler-sfc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/compiler-sfc) actually. 

Although based on previous PRs:
>  (we used to do CSR + ship the raw, uncompiled template which took very long to render)

~The difference is that this PR currently takes the approach of SSR + ship raw, uncompiled template. (need to consider how long it will take to render)~

Will need to do further investigation

Edit: OK nvm I managed to reimplemented Server Side Compilation of Render Functions after diving into the codebase for `@vue/compiler-sfc`

I am currently facing issues which @EltonGohJH previously [faced](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2084):

> `resolveComponent can only be used in render() or setup() error.`
> Occurs due to multiple Vue instances.? For SSR, the issue persists because two different Vue files are used (runtime-core.cjs.js and runtime-core.esm-bundler.js). This makes it non-trivial to solve, so SSR has been disabled for now. This is not trivial to debug.

Not too sure how to resolve this issue, but am looking into the matter.

Secondly, &lt;overlay> and related components that utilize portal vue also face the issue of `Cannot read property 'isCE' of null in remote component with slot `. Preliminary [research](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/4344) suggests that this issue is also a result of having multiple Vue Instances.

I have reformatted and opened a new PR for the Vue migration #2622 . It has been structured to be as easy to follow as possible. 

As advised by @tlylt , I have made best effort to break the work done into manageable chunks for reviewers and other developers.

I have isolated separable code changes into separate PRs as much as possible, which have since been merged. 
* (PRs: 2625, 2626, 2614). 
* The final PR2622 contains the minimal (Best Effort) amount of code changes to functionally migrate Vue 2 to Vue 3.

Additionally, in the PR and the description, currently, I have:
* Modularized the commits - each commit deals with a logically separable component in the migration process. 
* Added an overview and detailed description for each commit - what is done with each commit, grouped logically. 
* Hyperlinked where convenient — Direct links to referenced commits, packages, external documentation to help in navigating quickly and access necessary context.
* Added release note preparation, some suggested testing instruction, related issues for context at appropriate places and some other stuff.

Hope it makes it easier on PR reviewers! Will close this PR.

Thanks for your effort on this PR! @AgentHagu . This would definitely help immensely with the DevOps process.

One suggestion! - We could also consider excluding the test files from our build pipeline, if it is determined that we don't need the js files at all to run the tests. This can complement the test config, so there are two layers of checks to ensure we don''t run duplicated test files. E.g.:
```
``{``
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.test.ts"]
``}``
```
I referenced from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71385372/why-is-jest-running-the-typescript-test-files-and-then-the-compiled-js-test-file)

When we add more tests in the future, it can help reduce workload on `tsc` and also keep our IDE folder less cluttered

I think the logic here could be a bit clearer. I think it could be optimized to be easier to follow. 

 1. Perhaps consider storing `immediateHighlight` in a separate variable instead of mutating `str` and returning it? This could make the logic much clearer to understand, e.g. something like
```
// FOR REFERENCE ONLY idk if it directly works
const immediateHighlight = highlightRules.find((rule) => ``{``
  return rule.getHighlightType(currentLineNumber).some((``{`` highlightType, color ``}``) => ``{``
    if (highlightType === HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.WholeLine) ``{``
      return Highlighter.highlightWholeLine(line, color);
    ``}``
    if (highlightType === HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.WholeText) ``{``
      return Highlighter.highlightWholeText(line, color);
    ``}``
    return false;
  ``}``);
``}``);

if (immediateHighlight) ``{``
  return immediateHighlight;
``}``
```

2. Maybe pull out the `boundsWithColors` earlier, since it seems to have different logic (returns `false`, handled outside). Maybe it would be better to handle outside of `hasImmediateReturn`. Can also consider using `map`, `flatmap` as well to directly define `boundsWithColors`. But mostly to separate out the logic.

```
const boundsWithColors = highlightRules.flatMap((rule) =>
  rule.getHighlightType(currentLineNumber)
    .filter((``{`` highlightType, bounds ``}``) => highlightType === HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.PartialText && bounds)
    .flatMap((``{`` bounds, color ``}``) => bounds.map(bound => (``{`` bounds: bound, color: color || '' ``}``)))
);
```

Is the parent `str` being overwritten in the map? 

If the parent str is the final concatenated result it should not be overwritten inside the loop?

Let me know if I am misunderstanding something. 

Edit:  Is the `str` supposed to be a different variable? Perhaps we could rename this variable inside the map to another name would be better?

```
// HERE
  str = lines.map((line, index) => ``{``
    const currentLineNumber = index + 1;
    const highlightedLine = line; // Start with the original line

    // Collect all bounds and colors for partial text highlights
    const boundsWithColors: Array<``{`` bounds: [number, number], color: string ``}``> = [];

    const hasImmediateReturn = highlightRules.some((rule) => ``{``
      const results = rule.getHighlightType(currentLineNumber);
      return results.some((result) => ``{``
        const ``{`` highlightType, bounds, color ``}`` = result;
        const highlightColor = color || '';

        if (highlightType === HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.WholeLine) ``{``
          // HERE
          str = Highlighter.highlightWholeLine(highlightedLine, highlightColor);
          return true;

        ``}`` else if (highlightType === HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.WholeText) ``{``
          // HERE
          str = Highlighter.highlightWholeText(highlightedLine, highlightColor);
          return true;

        ``}`` else if (highlightType === HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.PartialText && bounds) ``{``
          bounds.forEach((bound) => ``{``
            boundsWithColors.push(``{`` bounds: bound, color: highlightColor ``}``);
          ``}``);

          return false;
        ``}``
        return false;
      ``}``);
    ``}``);

    if (hasImmediateReturn) ``{``
      return str;
    ``}``

    if (boundsWithColors.length > 0) ``{``
      return Highlighter.highlightPartOfText(line, boundsWithColors);
    ``}``

    return `<span>$``{``highlightedLine``}``\n</span>`;
  ``}``).join('');

Here's a side by side comparison of the effect of changing this style:

* The indentation of bullet points gets pushed "inside" the bullet content:

Left - New (this PR), Right - Old (master-netlify)


While this fix does indeed solve the issue, I wonder if there is a more stylish way to go about it, as it does increase the indentation substantially...

I realized it's related to https://markbind.org/userGuide/tipsAndTricks.html#using-raw-endraw-to-display-content 

It's probably a known issue and maybe not exactly a bug.

Though, i think it could be relevant to make the documentation a bit more user friendly and add `' raw ' ``{`` content ``}`` ``{``v-pre``}`` ' endraw '` to use it as a raw string by itself.

Also maybe it is worth pointing this specific bug out in troubleshooting? Rather than tips and tricks. I also think it could be helpful to add a FAQ or expand the troubleshooting session? as when making new markbind sites and deploying github pages I keep troubleshooting the same rookie mistakes like not updating baseURL to site.json, branch change from master to main, or adding ``{`` baseurl ``}`` to diagrams etc. etc. ?

Thank you for the insights! I agree with the notion that the troubleshooting section shouldn't (optimally) be something that users should look to go to! (Did not think of that). Looking back, I realized that the user/dev guide is quite comprehensive, but the issue was that I didn't know where to look because I didn't know the specific term to search. 

I think this just highlights the importance of having a full text search available (which I am refining now!).  

The use of the reuse to highlight common errors sounds like a good idea.

## Vue Migration Vue 2 to Vue 3

MarkBind (v5.5.3) is currently using Vue 2. Vue2 has reached EOL, (end-2023) and will not receive any type of support. Packages supporting Vue2 used may not be maintained by extension. This limits the extensibility and maintainability of MarkBind, especially the vue-components package. (UI Library Package).

Vue3 has TypeScript support, noticeable performance improvements and more responsive application. Also has smaller bundle size. Do note that  Vue 3 does not support IE13 (internet explorer).  Note that the migration is a time intensive process with codebase understanding required. Currently, MarkBind Vue components are authored in the Vue Options API style. While migrating to Vue 3, we should continue to use this API style. Future work can consider cost benefit of switching to using Composition API.

[Breaking changes](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/) to expect include: breaking Vue framework API changes, different dependencies used for Vue 2 vs Vue 3, SSR.

Intricate understanding of both Vue 2, Vue 3, low-level dependency APIs and MarkBind (in particular with regards to SSR, Hydrating, Bundling) is needed to conduct this. Some relevant links to understanding / reviewing the PR:

## Work To-Do

### **Compilation and SSR of Vue (Core):**

`Page/PageVueServerRenderer.ts` needs to be updated
1. [x] 'vue-template-compiler' has been replaced by '@vue/compiler-sfc', hence`compileVuePageAndCreateScript` method which compiles page into Vue Application to get the render function must be updated. For Vue 3, the way the render function is created and consumed is different. Do this without disabling SSR.
2. [x] `renderVuePage`: Method that Renders Vue page app into html string (Vue SSR). Ensure that it works during migration process. Updated to use `@vue/server-render` package for Vue3
3. [x] Ensure no regressions, do testing etc.

### **Webpack bundling (Core-Web)**
`Core-Web` library needs to be updated
1. [x] Update `core-web/src/index.js` setup() process. Ensure setup functions for mounting Vue apps are not affected. Updated to use new Vue `app instance` setup API.
2. [x] Update `vue-loader` package
3. [x] Update webpack configurations if relevant.
4. [x] Ensure bundling no regressions, (to do after refactoring vue components) 
5. [x] `VueCommonAppFactory.js`.The appFactory helps create the Vue app instances needed for each page, to set up the necessary configurations. Configure it if necessary for Vue 3, and adapt if needed for compatibility with Vue3 components

### **Vue Components SFCs**
Vue-Components Library needs to be updated
- [x] Update vue-components SFCs.
- [x] Update dependencies and librarie used
Note: Vue 2 Options API -&gt; Vue 3 Options API should not have too many changes. Should be the most straightforward process. However, a lot of dependencies have to be updated such as `floating vue`, etc. 
- [x] Ensure no regressions as in https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1519

### **Vue Testing**
Update all testing packages and dependencies
- [x] Update testing dependencies for Vue 3
- [x] Update tests (to be done after vue components refactoring)

### **Plugins:**
Update necessary plugins (change in Vue directive API)
1.  [x] Ensure usability and non-regression of `dataTable` plugin as Vue Directive used.
2.  [x] Ensure usability and non-regression of `Mermaid` plugins as Vue Directive used.


## Relevant Changelog Vue2 to Vue3:  (FYI)
> Global Mounting: Vue.js 2: The global Vue instance is used to mount the root component. Vue.js 3: Introduces createApp for creating the application instance and makes the mounting process more explicit.

* In Vue 2, plugins add global level functionality. In Vue 3, each `createApp` call creates completely isolated app instance with its own config and global properties. Due to differences, the Vue instance is setup differently.
* Migrating from `new Vue` to createSSRApp(): case study [here](https://v3.ru.vuejs.org/guide/render-function.html) on using render function
* In Vue2, static render functions explicitly separated from main render function, but in Vue3, it is not. Hence, only one render function. (`compileVuePageAndCreateScript`)
* package `vue-server-renderer` is for Vue 2.0. Corresponding functionality for Vue 3 is in `@vue/server-renderer`, which is actually a dependency of the main `vue` package.


>  Custom Directives: Vue.js 2: Custom directives are registered globally using Vue.directive. Vue.js 3: Custom directives are registered using the app.directive method, making it more modular and scoped to the app instance.


## FAQ
- What about considering letting vue2 and vue3 co-exist? 
We can use a migration build (Vue 2.7) that allows both Vue 2 & 3 code in a single codebase. Once done, migrate over to Vue 3.  However, I faced some issues with getting `@vue/compat` to work.

Realized it takes a bit more than that. In Vue 2, custom directives are registered globally using `Vue.directive`. However, in Vue , custom directives are registered using the `app.directive` method, making it more modular and scoped to the app instance. 

This means that we can't just grab the global Vue instance and install the directive. We would have to register the directive on the current Vue instance we are using to render the page, before rendering or hydrating. 

Maybe will consider 
#2548 Support Mermaid Diagrams in Offline Mode
#2529 Make Mermaid, Datatables Default
since the overhaul is going to be necessary.

%%[created at: 2025 Feb 25 23:46:52]%%

I think we could consider different implementations to make this work

## Alternative Implementations
### Mount Multiple Vue instance for each Mermaid Element
This is alternative to attaching the directive to parent app Vue instance.  Initializing a new vue instance for each Mermaid diagram, registering the mermaid directive for that specific instance.
Ensures that each diagram has its own scoped configuration and avoids issues with Vue 3's global app instance limitations. However, this could lead to performance overhead if many Mermaid diagrams are rendered on a page. (Unsure)

### Direct Mutation of Mermaid Elements
Directly mutate Mermaid elements outside of Vue’s reactive. Could involve simply manipulating the DOM and invoking Mermaid’s rendering functions manually on element. Since the mermaid script runs after html is hydrated by Vue, on client side. 

## Plugin vs. Default Features

Making it a plugin vs. default feature: I think if we make it default there are definitely size and performance impacts, thank you for pointing it out, overlooked this crucial aspect.

Considering this, I think it definitely makes sense to keep these features as plugins.

### Difference in size / performance

A quick test on [markbind.org](https://markbind.org/) shows 
(`dev tools` -&gt; `sources` -&gt; `plugins/dataTable/datatables.min.js` || `mermaid-5a5980d4.js` or record network )
* mermaid.js file to be at 322kb, 
* datatable.js + css file at 192kb
(actual sizes after compression are 102+62kB)
 
which is actually quite hefty. E.g. if you load markbind.org, you need to process(~0.5 mb) of just the plugin `js` scripts even if no datatable or mermaid element on current page.

**Potential Fix to complement trade-off of offline support and dynamic loading**:
One quick way I can think of is that perhaps we can provide a toggle through plugin context to toggle between offline support (bundling js file) and dynamic online importing - what do you think?

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

Header with name 'Page Nav' or 'Site Nav' both get compiled to html with id='page-nav' or id='site-nav'. Specifically, `` gets compiled into `&lt;h2 id="page-nav">... &lt;/h2>`. This causes it to get "pulled-in" to the navigation menus. 

* See [https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/navigation.html#navbars](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/navigation.html#navbars)
* It is expected behavior that the navbar 'pulls in' container elements with HTML `id` of `site-nav` or `page-nav`.

However, this is probably unwanted behavior. This causes some styling issues, and also results in these specific headers disppearing when we are using a mobile view.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7813493-5d71-4207-b4c6-a528bdb964e6)

Also want to ask about the usability of this particular feature 
* any content or picture etc. that gets pulled in, not placed in a very intuitive way out of box.
* Only gets pulled in when in mobile view
* Hard to style, can include custom `&lt;style/>`, but not very user friendly.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ba5b933-1b7a-4e9a-9817-d90bfa8286dc)

Just for discussion, is there any strong use case for this feature?

It seems like it was the result of the implementation of `&lt;site-nav-button>` and `&lt;page-nav-button>` as per https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/1445

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

Several vue-component tests are erroneous.

See:
https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/008aa1d36fe193e0b1fddc784b907794b1d6fa15/packages/vue-components/src/__tests__/Box.spec.js#L227-L240

Actually, only the wrapper is being compared. So the test is not really testing anything. For instance, you could even mount a different component and the test would pass. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2d4835-9abc-4121-9867-f3e474d92d2d)



Other things:
* If facing issues getting the jest to compile, try removing your jest cache. `npx jest --clearCache`. Faced this issue, but could be because I have been swapping configurations between Vue 2 and Vue 3.
* To run individual tests, the path (e.g. `npm test ./src/__tests__/Box.spec.js` needs to be delimited by `/` not `\`. For case of autocomplete path on windows. (Bc. of default test regex).


### Other components:

On line 7 the class is actually not closed. 

#### Popovers

Some of the snapshot tests for popovers don't really seem to test functionality rather than just testing on the surface given the stubs.

## CLI Tests

There are error messages in the MarkBind `packages/cli` tests. See:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49359d40-2b8c-4656-b3c3-58a47faad79d)

- I am running this on master branch, individually through `cd packages/ cli; npm run test`. Due to the tests running in parallel, if you run `npm run test` from root, lerna will run tests in parallel, so test messages are warped, makes debugging hard. So best to run each test locally individually.

Additionally, in the latest PR check, this 'error' also shows.
https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/actions/runs/13458086184/job/37606471167#step:8:233

## Core Tests

There are also error messages when running `core` tests. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bac0268-c4c8-4368-a0b5-4a173face017)

i.e. cyclic reference, does not exist. 

## Issue

This error is misleading. Is this supposed to be expected behaviour? If it is, could the error be caught and not shown? 
* I suspect this is the case for core tests.

Otherwise, is the test actually failing in some segment, but reported as pass?
* I suspect this might be the case for cli tests, hopefully not.

This should not be the case.

Currently, have implemented a quick fix in my own branch, but I think this needs serious investigation.

The project's current typescript configuration settings are:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/2cadb784fb53f6135ddd070056190142b50dc6d4/tsconfig_base.json#L1-L14

While reading typescript documentation, I noticed perhaps the `module` option should be updated moving forward (particularly, set to `node16 / nodenext`), `moduleResolution` also needs to be updated correspondingly, especially as we continue to update Node.js versions (See tip-box in picture):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dac53fc-b5aa-4f3f-a1e7-83237ca1c85b)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68059b63-0b2e-4982-9e1c-10bba1338e1f)


* [Image-Source](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/theory.html#the-module-output-format)



* [ESM support in Node.js introduced in TypeScript 4.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-7.html)
* [Module Option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#module)
* [Module Resoultion Option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#moduleResolution)

Many project dependencies have also rewritten to ESM, while CJS fallback is still available for some, it is likely some packages in the future may not have so.
* E.g. `markdown-it` changelog [here](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1400---2023-12-08)
* Edit: Because of their rewrite to `ESM`, cannot import [html_blocks.mjs](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/e92e7764111848ba26582322ce7be4fec6392470/lib/common/html_blocks.mjs) from updated version of `markdown-it`.


I haven't fully processed what this means and there is any possiblity for regressions etc. However, I note that previous efforts in integrating new node packages was impeded by this issue, as in #2477 , which was resolved by updating this module option.

Any further investigation would be helpful.

Additionally, some js files need to be migrated to typescript as well, which are still using old `require` and `module.exports` (CJS) -&gt; should use ESM: 
* e.g. `markbind\packages\core\src\patches\index.js`,
* `markbind\packages\core\src\patches\htmlparser2.js`

Noticed it on my local computer as well. Need to ctrl-c locally if tests fail to end. Only happens to certain tests failing.

Actions ran were only ultimately cancelled because a new commit was pushed over it. ( Members by default do not have access writes to cancel workflows).

Think it is for `packages/cli` tests, as they were the only ones that did not run to completion. Unsure if it is due running diff between expected site files and generated files that takes very long, which then it would actually stop, but just take very long.

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 09 19:19:13]%%

Some investigation on this:

I think I possibly made a wrong diagnosis on this - instead of not stopping, it is taking too long to load the diff between expected files and rendered html in the functional tests for the `cli` package tests.

This is related to #1637 #2631 

Two root causes - 
1. each change causes too many unrelated file changes
2. render functions diff also checked

This adds too much overhead such that the test does not finish in time. (even after 360 minutes - then auto aborted)

For example, the render function files are not ignored. An example of the render function file is:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/8c9de42d78a67e4e73d8ed06c39d741ed71ddeb2/packages/cli/test/functional/test_site/expected/index.page-vue-render.js#L2-L20

The snapshot tests also check for differences in the page render function - which is unnecessary and adds considerable overhead.

I will add additional explanation under #1637

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

The codeBlockCopyButtons.ts and codeBlockWrapButtons.ts plugins introduce unwanted side effects.

See:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/2cadb784fb53f6135ddd070056190142b50dc6d4/packages/core/src/plugins/codeBlockCopyButtons.ts#L67-L76

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/2cadb784fb53f6135ddd070056190142b50dc6d4/packages/core/src/plugins/codeBlockWrapButtons.ts#L51-L60

Both plugins process all `&lt;pre>` nodes and insert copy and wrap buttons to `&lt;pre>` elements if enabled, no matter if it contains `&lt;code>` or not. 

For some context, note that `markdown-it` follows the [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#fenced-code-blocks), and processes triple backticks into (''') into `&lt;pre/>` and `&lt;code>`.  For example, in the first code block below, this code snippet that we might  write in markdown file, gets converted to the following in html on the web page (second code block):

'''md
'''js
console.log("Hello, world!");
'''
'''
⬇ 
'''html
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-js">console.log("Hello, world!");&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
'''
We should minimize the side effect by only appending/inserting these code-copy or code-wrap buttons if we find `&lt;code>` in the `&lt;pre>` element. 

Why is this not just a trivial issue? The [`&lt;pre>` (preformatted text)](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_pre.asp) element is used to display text exactly as is written in HTML code, preserving spaces, line breaks and indentation. If any user wants to use this element, as per `HTML` specifications, they will incur this side effect if they have the plugin enabled. (- MarkBind should support `HTML`)

This also may have other unexpected effects on other components that use `&lt;pre>` to format their components. This includes - `mermaid` [example](https://mermaid.js.org/config/usage.html#simple-full-example), where the mermaid diagrams are formatted in `&lt;pre/>` elements for post-processing by mermaid js. Having the plugin enabled causes the buttons to be inserted in the element which should only contain the diagram code, causing the mermaid diagrams to fail to render because of the added syntax inside the block.


### Steps to Reproduce
Add to your site.json
'''
  "plugins": [
    "codeBlockWrapButtons",
    "codeBlockCopyButtons"
  ]
'''

We can test a negative impact of this side effect, try adding some ASCII Art as so:

Both copy and wrap buttons will show up beside the cat. (They should not show up since the cat is not code, the buttons should only show up for code blocks)

PRs #1043 and #1668 also add direct changes to `markbind.css`, which also have similar negative side effects (on mermaid, and possibly for future implementation). I propose to 1. shift the css changes into the plugins instead of adding it globally, and 2. better scope the css rules to minimize side effects:

This was also mentioned in the PR, I think it was a good catch which would have prevented this portion of the issue:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/1043#pullrequestreview-364223292

> Just a follow-up thought: It feels kinda odd that we add plugin styles to the main markbind.css file. Perhaps we should come up with a better way for plugin writers to keep assets contained within the plugin folder itself.

We can do this by using cheerio to add the style changes through head, or link it as an additional css file, instead of directly adding to the markbind css. This would be better for maintenance in the future as the css would be located together with the plugin.

Some overall refactoring would be good.

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

Test Sites have hydration Issues. 

This could be related to `&lt;span>` and invalid HTML rendered. And also special tags. Requires further investigation.

> A `&lt;div>` is a block-level element, whereas a &lt;span> is an inline element. When wrapping block-level elements (such as `&lt;p>, &lt;table>, &lt;div>`, etc.) inside a `&lt;span>`, it results in invalid HTML. This can cause hydration issues in frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte because:
> * DOM Mismatch: The server might render valid block-level elements, but the browser may restructure them due to invalid nesting. This leads to hydration errors because the expected DOM tree differs from the actual one.
> * Unexpected CSS Behavior: Block-level elements inside an inline &lt;span> may not inherit expected styles, leading to layout inconsistencies.
> * Breaking Semantic HTML: Wrapping blocks in &lt;span> violates HTML rules, which could lead to accessibility and SEO issues.

We could further investigate this issue once Vue is migrated to Vue 3

Not sure if it is entirely relevant since these test sites aren't technically meant to be served. However, the fact that there is a hydration issue / DOM mismatch causing Vue to bail and conduct full client side render could also mean that what is being tested and verified is not exactly what an end user would see on their browser - which would then also be an issue.

Investigation on this would be good.

To replicate:
*  `cd .\packages\cli\test\functional\test_site\`
*  `markbind serve -d`
* browser developer console




### Expected behavior

No hydration issues, no bailing of hydration and client side rendering for test sites.

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

After majority of test files were migrated to Typescript, the jest configuration files also need to be updated appropriately.

Notice that:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26136a99-4833-4f26-bba6-08616dc23ae2)

Both `ts` and `js` files are being run for tests! This could have been potentially doubling all testcase run times. (although not literally - tests are run in parallel).

This also translates to longer GitHub Actions runtimes for PRs, etc:

For example, see:

* https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/actions/runs/13746517217/job/38442074460?pr=2614#step:8:1551
> @markbind/core:  FAIL  test/unit/plugins/default/mermaid.test.js
* https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/actions/runs/13746517217/job/38442074460?pr=2614#step:8:1817
> @markbind/core:  FAIL  test/unit/plugins/default/mermaid.test.ts
 
Both the js and ts files are being run, although they are testing the same thing. 

Implementing a simple fix for this can help with the developer experience immensely.

### Expected behavior

Don't run duplicated test files.

Either run the ts, or the js file, or maybe run by file name.

### Anything else?

Think there's some other backlog that might have been forgotten in the process:

#2196 (parallel flag introduced during Lerna update)

### Tell us about your environment

Win 11

### MarkBind version

5.5.3

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

Currently, default behavior is to run tests (through Lerna) in
* markbind-cli
* @markbind/core
* @markbind/vue-components

in parallel.

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/8c9de42d78a67e4e73d8ed06c39d741ed71ddeb2/package.json#L22-L23

While it might increase the performance slightly by running in parallel, I think that we should prioritize clarity of logged success/error messages. I did a mini-test on performance on my local machine (it isn't very powerful).

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5c006c-50fb-4deb-b4c0-510445032a02)

There was a one second* decrease in time taken. Sometimes, the serial execution runs faster. It could be because of the overhead.

I think that the increase in performance does not outweigh the costs of making the tests parallel - mainly readability of test logs, on the local machine and on GH actions, when running all 3 test projects. Some examples of what I mean:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88a4e33d-a52a-46c1-a08f-b2154c40d885)

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/actions/runs/13746517217/job/38442074460?pr=2614#step:8:1399

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/actions/runs/13746517217/job/38442074460?pr=2614#step:8:399

Test outputs from `cli`, `core` and `vue-components` can become interweaved with each other, making them illegible  and possibly making the results less useful. Also harder to follow as a reader.

I think the scale (or lack thereof) of our tests don't necessary justify the usage of parallel tests.

Let's revert to doing the tests sequentially across packages!

If it is set to be parallel, it could make it harder to use or reason using the default debugging configuration.

I ran the crude timing comparison on my local computer. I suppose I could easily run it on CI to test it out. I think I raised a few other issues which I believe will massively improve the test efficiency so we can afford to run it sequentially.

I think there is some refactoring that could help optimize our testing for developer experience and future maintenance efforts.

Currently, the "test jumbotron" has 57 pages testing a variety of components.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5595fa6-df71-4771-9186-f0d362b28645)

In particular, 

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/8c9de42d78a67e4e73d8ed06c39d741ed71ddeb2/packages/cli/test/functional/test_site/site.json#L229-L258

Test jumbotron also does tests for most of the plugins.

Why is this an issue? Most of the plugins append some `js` script to the html of a page. This means that any updates to the plugin script (comment, typo etc) would mean that an update to numerous snapshot test files ( in particular - more than 57 pages).

This is demonstrated in PR #2614 - a change in mermaid script indirectly causes 4k+ LoC changes, much of which is due to adding duplicated script content to irrelevant pages. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dfdc076-a15d-4aba-ae1f-10ab1797b370)

The same issue could occur if we update other plugins - `web3Form`, `googleAnalytics` etc. Let'a adopt an approach as in `dataTables` plugin - create a new (minimal) site to do functional tests per plugins, i.e. modularize the test sites. This is so we can keep the scope of changes limited and give any PR reviewer a much easier time as well.

This is highly related to #1637 (test site improvements). I want to highlight that the ignoring of the render function file in this issue is also very relevant and can be tackled  in a similar PR. - Although it is not hard to do so, it would be quite beneficial.


I hope this issue can provide some context as to why refactoring of the test files would be good.

### MarkBind version

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

The v-closeable directive currently attaches mouseover and mouseout event listeners directly to the DOM element without any cleanup logic. This leads to memory leaks and duplicate event listener bindings when the directive element is toggled with v-if or when the component is unmounted and remounted. (Edge case if the directive is used in other vue components).

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/c8f0e1a817e5b4ceb00c38ed5727c84c548fbcc9/packages/vue-components/src/directives/Closeable.js#L1-L69

### Suggested Fix

* Store the event listener functions (e.g., in el._closeable) when adding them
* On unmounting, we remove the event listeners

```
el.removeEventListener('mouseover', el._closeable.onMouseOver);
el.removeEventListener('mouseout', el._closeable.onMouseOut);
delete el._closeable;
```


### Expected behavior

The directive should clean up event listeners on unmount to avoid memory leaks and ensure no duplicate bindings occur.

To reproduce:

  Plain text with closeable directive

vs.

<div v-closeable>

  Markdown with closeable directive 
</div>
```

Here is a screenshot:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59659422-b661-466f-a436-a61cd4e9b507)

See that the `v-closeable` directive does not work with plain text.

If not familiar, some relevant understanding of 'plain text', 'markdown text', and 'closeable'.

**Markdown Text vs Plaintext**
* https://markbind.org/userGuide/usingHtmlJavaScriptCss.html#markdown-in-html

**Closeable Directive** (not obvious)
* https://markbind.org/userGuide/reusingContents.html#allowing-users-to-remove-some-contents

(Note that the built-in closeable directive in MarkBind shows a popup that allows it to be closed into a link.)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ce08b3-d06b-45d4-9067-f6e3f6fd1bce)


### Expected behavior

Should work for plain text too. (shouldn't work only for elements such as markdown elements or `<p>` elements etc.

### Anything else?

This is due to this line:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/c8f0e1a817e5b4ceb00c38ed5727c84c548fbcc9/packages/vue-components/src/directives/Closeable.js#L52-L57

Line 54: `el.children`.

This is an issue if the element contains text nodes (e.g., from whitespace, line breaks, or raw text content), those won't be selected by `el.children`. But if you're trying to move all contents, including those text nodes for plain text (e.g., `Plain text`), text nodes are lost — so the `<div>` will appears empty.

Instead, we should use `el.childNode`. `Array.from(el.childNodes).forEach(child => content.append(child));`

Lifted from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/childNodes
> It is important to keep in mind that childNodes includes all child nodes, including non-element nodes like text and comment. To get a collection containing only elements, use [Element.children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/children) instead.

Summary:

 Currently, animation for questions components (buttons) has been disabled. We should find a way to meaningfully re-enable it under Vue 3, can also consider more stylish animations if wanted too.

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

Due to a difference in `portal-vue` rendering mechanism from vue 2 to vue 3, the styling applied to site-nav, page-nav, overlaysource etc. and components that may use `portal-vue` may have become overly complicated and less sensible. 

Let's take the chance to refactor the styling logic. 

Additionally, anyone who might want to take on this issue could possibly also do some investigation into using Vue 3's Teleport feature, since it is related. I think that handling this issue would be a good way to start to understand how `portal-vue`, and `Teleport` work.

> Vue 3 has a new Teleport feature which replaces the portal-vue plugin in vue 2.
> Vue 3 is the current, latest major version of Vue. It contains new features that are not present in Vue 2, such as Teleport, Suspense, and multiple root elements per template

https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/teleport 

This means that MarkBind could possibly do away with having `portal-vue` as a dependency in the vue components that use it. This could make the code base much easier to understand as it would be more unified.


The investigation of using Teleport can cumulate into a separate issue, handled by a separate PR.

----

I have investigated and identified the cause of regression for site-nav and page-nav whitespace. 

This was due to a change in `portal-vue` rendering mechanism, specifically [portal-target no longer rendering a root element](https://portal-vue.linusb.org/guide/migration.html#portaltarget-component)
* A high-level explanation - Due to this expectation, the style attribute accounting for the `--sticky-header-height` was applied twice, causing this whitespace.
* Fix: applied a parent div to `portal-target` to 'absorb' this styling to maintain the expectation as per `vue-portal` v2. I have also done a rough check for other components that use portal-vue if such fix is required, but not needed as their styling is not affected as per a preliminary check.

* We can consider refactoring this in the future.  However, note that the change to refactor is not too trivial and requires some significant understanding of current styling in `main.css`, with regards to `#page-nav` and `#site-nav`, and how it interacts with `Overlay`, `OverlaySource`, and `portal-vue`.

There is some warnings when building the CS2103 website. However, I suspect that it might not be an issue brought about by migration of Vue, but rather an existing issue that was previously hidden, but as Vue 3 renderer now prints out warnings. However, either way it warrants some investigation.

I haven't noticed any functional regressions due to this warning.

I am proposing to up the priority of this issue. (To at least p.Medium, if not high).

Some context to why the simple act of ignoring render files can drastically improve overhead and developer experience.

## Context and Explanation to understand this Issue

What is the `page-vue.render,js` function? This function is pre-generated on the server side, and sent over to the web client to render / hydrate the HTML received. Currently, in the Vue 2 implementation of MarkBind, this is where this function is generated: https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/8c9de42d78a67e4e73d8ed06c39d741ed71ddeb2/packages/core/src/Page/PageVueServerRenderer.ts#L39-L68

For more information, read up to MarkBind's [Server Side Rendering](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/design/serverSideRendering.html). (I think that it can be more descriptive - which is another issue for a subsequent time). So, whenever there is a change in the html content, there will inevitably be a change in the js render function. Note that these render functions can be more than thousands of lines long, with numerous characters per line. Because these render functions are auto-compiled, they are not meant to be human readable.


Currently for the snapshot tests, the render function files are not ignored. An example of the render function file is:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/8c9de42d78a67e4e73d8ed06c39d741ed71ddeb2/packages/cli/test/functional/test_site/expected/index.page-vue-render.js#L1-L337

The snapshot tests currently check for differences in rendered HTML, AND the page render function - which is unnecessary and adds considerable overhead. For example, I make a change that causes a regression in the rendered HTML file. We see that the test detects at least two differences - one in the `index.html`, and one in the `render function`

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b9e836-1c45-439a-a4e8-35ebef157fd8)

The change in index.html shown is useful. The change in the render function is not as much so. Additionally, because the render function is sometimes generated in a single line, unrelated changes pollute the CLI and makes it hard to identify the change or regression.

Furthermore, this effectively doubles or exponentially increases the workload of the snapshot tests (render functions are understandably more verbose than finished, rendered HTML), making it take at least double as much time to check diffs.

### Fix 

Gitignore the page-vue.render.js files containing the vue applications as the diffs are unreadable.

I wanted to raise an issue about this but realized it was a known issue. I wanted to add some context and understanding, and summarize the discussion, for future developers who might work on this issue:

**Issue**: Some Vue components are using scoped styles. (e.g. `submenu`) Some vue components are not using scoped styles. (e.g. `pic`). Currently, there is no clear direction to use or not. So the usage of scoped in vue components styling is inconsistent now.

**Benefit of using `scoped`**:
* If not scoped, class names and css used can `leak` globally, and can affect user specified elements and classes in the rare case they use the same class name. 

Here, I use the example of styles defined in `Pic.vue`, and show how the non-scoped style could theoretically be an issue.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ac311df-910f-41d7-91ee-9b636a0fcea9)

Hence, if it is scoped, there will not be any unwanted global css effects. (Second row)

**Disadvantage of using `scoped`**:
* Performance hit of `scoped`. [vue](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#scoped-style-tips), [vue-loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html#dynamically-generated-content)
* Styling becomes more intentional and deliberate, making it harder. This is because to affect child components (E.g. slotted content, other components) selectors such as `deep` need to be used. [deep](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#deep-selectors)


Moving forward:
* Consider impact on performance and decide accordingly.
* If choosing to not scope, rather the focus should be on standardization across components, and standardizing namespacing of styles used, and perhaps adding this in the documentation to be known to users.

> So any attempt at this should be motivated by standardisation (also taking the opportunity to namespace our styles)

## Vue Migration Vue 2 to Vue 3

Vue Migration Guide [here](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/)

Issues that typically come up are related to both breaking Vue framework API changes and dependencies used in Vue 2 vs Vue 3.

### **Compilation and SSR of Vue (Core):**

- [ ] `Page/PageVueServerRenderer.ts` needs to be updated
1. 'vue-template-compiler' has been replaced by '@vue/compiler-sfc', hence`compileVuePageAndCreateScript` method which compiles page into Vue Application to get the render function must be updated.

2. `renderVuePage`: Method that Renders Vue page app into html string (Vue SSR). Ensure that it works during migration process. 

### **Webpack bundling (Core-Web)**
- [ ] `core-web` library needs to be updated
1. Update `core-web/src/index.js` setup process. Ensure setup functions for mounting Vue apps are not affected.

Issue I currently face here:
- pageVueServerRenderer attaches the render function
- core-web source uses the render function
for Vue 3, the way the render function is created and consumed is different. I noticed that @\EltonGohJH 's old PR didnt manage to resolve this and hence disabled SSR - trying to resolve this.

 Relevant Changelog: 
> Global Mounting: Vue.js 2: The global Vue instance is used to mount the root component. Vue.js 3: Introduces createApp for creating the application instance and makes the mounting process more explicit.

| Feature              | Vue 2                          | Vue 3                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Instance Creation    | `new Vue()`                    | `createApp()`                  |
| Global Configuration | On Vue constructor             | On app instance                |
| Global APIs          | Attached to Vue                 | Instance methods on app        |
| Reactivity System    | `Object.defineProperty`        | `Proxy`                        |
| Composition API      | Not available                  | Available                      |
| Fragments            | Single root element required   | Multiple root elements allowed |
| Teleport             | Not available                  | Built-in `&lt;teleport>` support  |

* In Vue 2, plugins add global level functionality. In Vue 3, each `createApp` call creates completely isolated app instance with its own config and global properties. Due to differences, the Vue instance is setup differently.
* Migrating from `new Vue` to createSSRApp(): case study [here](https://v3.ru.vuejs.org/guide/render-function.html) on using render function
* In Vue2, static render functions explicitly separated from main render function, but in Vue3, it is not. Hence, only one render function. (`compileVuePageAndCreateScript`)
* package `vue-server-renderer` is for Vue 2.0. Corresponding functionality for Vue 3 is in `@vue/server-renderer`, which is actually a dependency of the main `vue` package.


2. `VueCommonAppFactory.js`.The appFactory helps create the Vue app instances needed for each page, to set up the necessary configurations. Configure it if necessary for Vue 3, and dependencies used if any.

### **Vue Components SFCs**
- [ ] Vue-Components Library needs to be updated

- Update vue-components library where needed.
Note: Vue 2 Options API -&gt; Vue 3 Options API should not have too many changes. Should be the most straightforward process. However, a lot of dependencies have to be updated such as `floating vue`, etc. Not too sure yet. Working on vue rendering first.

### **Plugins:**
- [ ] Update necessary plugins 
1. Ensure usability and non-regression of `dataTable` and `Mermaid` plugins as they use Vue Directives.

 Relevant Changelog: 
>  Custom Directives: Vue.js 2: Custom directives are registered globally using Vue.directive. Vue.js 3: Custom directives are registered using the app.directive method, making it more modular and scoped to the app instance.


### **Others:**
- Why Migrate to Vue 3?
Vue2 has reached EOL, (end-2023) and will not receive any type of support. Packages supporting Vue2 used may not be maintained by extension. Vue3 has TypeScript support, noticeable performance improvements and more responsive application. Also has smaller bundle size. However, Vue 3 does not support IE13 (internet explorer). Migration is a time intensive process with codebase understanding required.


- What about considering letting vue2 and vue3 co-exist? 
We can use a migration build (Vue 2.7) that allows both Vue 2 & 3 code in a single codebase. Once done, migrate over to Vue 3.  However, I faced some issues with getting `@vue/compat` to work.

### **Sources:** 
- [Migration QA](https://www.monterail.com/blog/vue-3-migration-qa)
- [Vue2-Vue3 Differences](https://blog.shiftasia.com/difference-between-vuejs-2-and-3-when-to-use-them/)
- [Official Migration Guide](https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/migration-build.html)

Issues faced:
- No documentation in most packages, most just specify 'For detailed API references and options, check out the source type definitions in GitHub Repo' 🤕 🙃 

Will open a draft PR soon regarding work done on this.

%%[created at: 2025 Feb 26 00:33:06]%%

Duplicated comment from #2597 as more relevant to this issue.

Some contextual knowledge for anyone reading this to better understand from quick glance: very simply, 

> The DataTable and Mermaid plugins work by manipulating the page after it’s been rendered by Vue.

> For the DataTable plugin, it first looks for custom &lt;d-table> elements, then converts them into regular HTML tables. Based on their attributes, like sortable or searchable, it applies the necessary configuration to make them interactive using the jQuery DataTable plugin.

> The Mermaid plugin operates similarly, searching for Mermaid-specific elements on the page after it’s loaded. It then uses Mermaid's rendering functions (using loaded js script) to convert those elements into diagrams.

---

I think we could consider different implementations to make this work

## Alternative Implementations
### Mount Multiple Vue instance for each Mermaid Element
This is alternative to attaching the directive to parent app Vue instance.  Initializing a new vue instance for each Mermaid diagram, registering the mermaid directive for that specific instance.
Ensures that each diagram has its own scoped configuration and avoids issues with Vue 3's global app instance limitations. However, this could lead to performance overhead if many Mermaid diagrams are rendered on a page.

### Direct Mutation of Mermaid Elements
Directly mutate Mermaid elements outside of Vue’s reactive. Could involve simply manipulating the DOM and invoking Mermaid’s rendering functions manually on element. Since the script runs after html is hydrated by Vue on client side. 

## Plugin vs. Default Features

Making it a plugin vs. default feature: I think if we make it default there are definitely size and performance impacts, thank you for pointing it out, overlooked this crucial aspect.

Considering this, I think it definitely makes sense to keep these features as plugins.

### Difference in size / performance

A quick test on [markbind.org](https://markbind.org/) shows 
(`dev tools` -&gt; `sources` -&gt; `plugins/dataTable/datatables.min.js` || `mermaid-5a5980d4.js`)
* mermaid.js file to be at 322kb, 
* datatable.js + css file at 192kb
 
which is actually quite hefty. E.g. if you load markbind.org, you need to load (~0.5 mb) of just the plugin `js` scripts. In fact, right now, even if you don't have any datatable or mermaid on the current page you need to load these script, as long as you enabled the plugins&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>. 

If we continue this approach, providing mermaid offline support just mean to bundle it as needed as done with DataTable.


One quick way I can think of is that perhaps we can provide a toggle through plugin context to toggle between offline support and online support - what do you think?


## Side Note

&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> I just realized there is potential for easy quick efficiency fix to current mermaid plugin - if no mermaid elements then we don't load mermaid script, because now it indiscriminately loads mermaid script on every page on load, if plugin is enabled @Tim-Siu . I can make a quick PR (#2614) to demonstrate what I mean.

Based on my work refactoring the dataTable plugin, I believe that the dataTable plugin is already supported offline in the initial PR2446 adding the plugin.

The binary file is included in our core package:

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/3aa59b5037545157ca017678f6f85db1a4cd5411/packages/core/src/plugins/dataTableAssets/datatables.min.js#L1-L11

Here's a test showing it works offline (🌐 disabled). 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0dd685f-8838-4d12-bb9d-6cd296aaedab)

I think the decision to make dataTable available offline was because the js binary is quite small in comparison to mermaid js binary.

However, Mermaid diagrams aren't currently supported offline. I think we could focus on that.

Hi @GrassHeadd, thank you for raising the issue! 

The closing button is the feature of the custom vue directive that enables users to close / minimize elements for better viewability while navigating pages. It is an overlay positioned absolutely at the top left of the element, it currently overlaps the content slightly. 
* Note that this would make it hard to cause an expected behavior of shifting the content within the element, since it is an overlay.

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/9c33eb47c4c4e79f1a97b1acc4173aa53fcff195/packages/vue-components/src/directives/Closeable.js#L1-L69


Given that the close button only appears when the cursor is hovering over the element, and that it is designed to be small and unobtrusive, I believe it generally does not interfere significantly with content readability. However, in cases like the activity diagram where the content is dense and important, I suppose it could be improved.

We could consider adding some repositioning options for the button (e.g., top-right) or adding padding/margin to shift the content slightly to avoid being covered when hovered etc. Depending on discussion and further input with the team, we could look into this issue, or close the issue if it is deemed less of a priority.

Thanks for the inputs. I reused the initial logic to handle for the case where I want the default coloring. Initially, highlights are dealt with by the highlighted class. So what I did is to have a conditional check at each highlight, if there is no color specified, I reused the logic of the highlighted class, else, I simply added a custom style depending on the color input.

Thanks for the suggestion! I think this can be added as an enhancement to this feature and would involve the following steps:

1. Adding validation for Bootstrap color classes (probably at HighlightRule.ts) 
2. Refactoring the highlighting logic to support both:
     - Class-based styling (for Bootstrap)
     - Current color/hex-based highlighting

Perhaps I could implement this as a separate follow-up PR? So that this PR is focused on color/hex highlighting functionality while the next one is focused on the Bootstrap Class support. What do you think?

Actually, overlapped intervals should not happen in the first place. I have discussed with @damithc  regarding this. We came to a decision to use the last color because it felt more intuitive. Perhaps the user was trying to highlight something with color A but decided to use another color at the end, he or she can simply do that by overlapping the current highlighted region with another color.

Users can specify a color using hex, for e.g. `#000000`. Using `#` to indicate color may lead to colors that are specified using hex to be incorrectly parsed. For e.g `1[:]##000000` will result in the color being wrongly parsed.

Correct me if I am wrong. I just thought it would be good to avoid introducing new symbols as far as possible to make it easier on the users.

Currently what the code does is it will split by `@` to obtain the color specified on the right of `@`, the color will then be added to the HTML like this `style="background-color:$``{``color``}``;"`.

If split by `#` to obtain the resulting hex, say `000000`, there will need to be additional checks before adding it into the HTML. This is because the current approach will result in something like `style="background-color:000000;"`

What about something that is not already present?

Reader Usability

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

I noticed that when I highlight text within a fenced block, the highlight color is black or grey depending on whether we are in light or dark mode. It can be frustrating because the highlight doesn't stand out very well.

For example in light mode, I think the highlight in orange stands out better as compared to the default highlight color

### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to propose allowing users to specify an additional field when typing out inline code. In the example below, the color field newly added.

```

java'''``{``.line-numbers highlight-lines="2" color="Orange"``}``
public class RandomNumberGenerator ``{``
    private int min;
    private int max;

    public RandomNumberGenerator(int min, int max) ``{``
        this.min = min;
        this.max = max;
    ``}``

    public int generate() ``{``
        return min + (int) (Math.random() * (max - min + 1));
    ``}``

    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        RandomNumberGenerator rng = new RandomNumberGenerator(1, 100);
        System.out.println("Random Number: " + rng.generate());
    ``}``
``}``

I have been working on this issue for a couple of days with no luck trying to resolve it. I will include some of my observations here, hopefully it helps anyone also working on it.

I tried to remove the use of the macro and use the tabs directly as shown in the picture below.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ec4d8b2-b1c6-4735-bb00-894857c49393)

Before, it was this.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ac67a2-cdf4-48a8-9cdd-3eef99a8f687)

Now, the tabs actually show. However, the word `SourceTree` does not appear.

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

The highlights in the fenced code has a very squarish highlight. This is in contrast to normal highlight, where there are paddings and rounded corners on both ends. I think it would be better if we have consistencies between the 2.

The first image here shows a highlight in the fenced code.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b712e1be-6eac-495b-8889-e3cdd496a67c)

The second image here shows a highlight outside of the fenced code.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07db6dd9-ec54-410e-80c7-f44bf7238c86)

### Describe the solution you'd like

I have actually tried tackling this problem for a week or so. My initial plan is to simply add a padding and rounded border when generating the html files. There are the 2 files reponsible for the creation of html files.
1. [https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/src/lib/markdown-it/highlight/Highlighter.ts](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/src/lib/markdown-it/highlight/Highlighter.ts)
Adding the appropriate paddings and rounded borders for the whole text and whole line highlight will work fine in this file. However, the problem lies with highlighting partial texts

2. [https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/src/html/codeblockProcessor.ts](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/src/html/codeblockProcessor.ts)
If we were to simply add the padding and rounded borders while generating the html files, the highlight will appear disjoint as shown in the picture below. This is due to the recursive nature of the code, as it applies the highlight to each section 1 by 1.

This is an enhancement of PR #2649 and is suggested by @tlylt . To highlight in a fenced code block, we can now either specify a color or a hex value. It would be good to support [bootstrap classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color/) as well!

### Describe the solution you'd like

There would probably be a need to discern if the color specified is a bootstrap class (--bs-emphasis-color) or a hex/color (#000000/black), before they could be further processed.

After which, just create the HTML as needed, which is pretty straight-forward.

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

As pointed by @lhw-1 in PR #2649, the usage of the color highlighting makes the string quite complex, especially if we have quite a number of highlighted items.

In the example given in PR #2649:
```
java ``{``.line-numbers highlight-lines="1[:]@pink,3['Inventory']@blue,3[4::6]@orange,4['It\'s designed']@#000000,5,6[8:15]@purple,6[18:]@yellow,8[0::2],12[:]-14,16-18,20[12:]-22,24[1::]-26"``}``
```
There should be a better way to organize the color highlighting for their code.

This is a follow up from the comment by @damithc under PR #2678.

It can be quite troublesome to look through the whole CS2103/T website to check for any differences between the new and current version, whenever a change is being made. 

Some of these tricky cases includes
#2670 
#2667

It would be good to have a 'test site' that contains all the corner cases we have envountered over time, to use it to easily smoke-test a new version.

Hi @damithc it is indeed due to the use of `@`. I tried changing the use of `@` to `~` and it works fine. Do you think it is acceptable to move on with this approach, or you would prefer an alternative approach? I think we have to choose a character that is rarely used to avoid similar issues in the future.

Ill update it so that it stays consistent with the convention that we are already using. I don't think there is much difference either, except maybe using `./` is a bit more explicit in defining the path.

@lhw-1 That is a good suggestion. We can try a colour combination that will not look out of place. For the text changes within the tooltip of text wrap, I'm thinking perhaps a change between "Wrap text" and "Unwrap text" depending on whether the text is wrapped.

I have just added changes to the wrap button. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c19d1c52-7a1b-4ea4-a0f7-f181297c6191)
It now changes to a slightly greyish tone to simulate that the code is currently wrapped. 

The tooltip text also changes to "unwrap text" to indicate that the next click would unwrap the code

> In terms of the tags, the current implementation seems to be an OR implementation; I am thinking if AND is more intuitive. Perhaps we could also provide a way to choose between the two behaviors?
> 
I discussed this with prof @damithc the other day during lecture and the consensus was that an OR search would better fit the purpose here since users are most likely going to filter according to what they want to appear in the card stack. As for whether we should allow users to choose between AND/ OR tag search, it is a good idea and I think we should have it too but it might lead to some inconsistencies in the final site when multiple card stacks are involved in the application and users toggle between them. 

>  And as a nit, in terms of the design, adding some space between the "Tags:" and the actual tags would be nice.

Will work on this!

> That aside, as @AgentHagu pointed out, the behavior of the search bar is rather unintuitive. Filtering based on the last keyword seems to be the current behavior, which is rather unexpected.

I have fixed this issue in the latest commit.

Could we review this pr for now and leave #2553 on hold in the meantime. I am trying to find a way to retireve all the icon names without having to manually copy and paste them from the source itself.

@lhw-1 Hi thanks for catching this issue! I have updated the code to fix the issue. 

> Additionally, hover focus seems to also activate this cursor change even though it only shows a popover and is not a clickable. Any thoughts @Incogdino?

I believe we should still leave users with the choice to make the annotations clickable but with a better indication that it is still clickable.

Ahh point noted. I misinterpreted your point and thought you were referring to whether the cursor change be activated through triggers.

> Having the pointer change on hover for clickable items is certainly good; but for popovers (i.e. activated on hover and not by clicking; clicking does nothing), I'm wondering if the cursor change is necessary. Pointer changes should indicate that something can be activated via clicking

@lhw-1 I believe the current behaviour for `hover focus` changes the cursor to a pointer and on clicking will remove the popover. I think that should be a relatively good use case for clicking?

Just a note for future reference: 
The current patch only works if the bot in this case is a bot from GitHub Apps. It does not work if the "bot" is a separate GitHub account automated by a user. In such a case, we would need to manually filter the account by its name.

Such a case would not arise since the function will only be called given that the legend option specifies a legend to be created and a label option is specified in the `v-if` directive 

```
    <div v-if="hasBottomText && hasLabel" class="legend-wrapper">
      <div class="text-header">
        ``{`` computedBottomHeader ``}``

@yucheng11122017 thanks for the review. I have changed the indent back to 4 spaces and alphabetize the attributes I added. I'm a bit unsure about the indentations for the css file since the [css coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/css.html) stated on the dev guide suggested an indentation of 2 spaces.

Allowing users to choose whether they want to enable this feature is a great point too!

The feature works as expected! Tested on windows.  

This feature can greatly reduce the time needed when testing the site!

A little shortcut I use during testing to shorten the time needed to load the webpage would be to specify the `-o` flag if the goal is to just test the output of a single page! This serves up a single page and loads the other pages only when they are navigated to.

I have the following ideas:
1. Allow for IPV6 addresses to be specified (though I dont see much reason a user might want to use it, except maybe for the shorthand for localhost `::1`)
2. Allow users to specify port number along with the IP address (the current implementation automatically redirects to a different port number if the default port is being used), though again, I don't quite see why users might want to specify separate ports

This is likely due to the `list-style-position` property applying to both ordered and unordered lists.

I think the issue is still relevant here. I tested this with using the markbind userGuide where removing `padding` defined in `main.css` using markbind layouts still causes the hundreth place of the list to be missing.

> In my opinion it's a known risk that styles might break if users choose to update the default css, any other styling might also break if done incorrectly.

I agree that keeping styling outside should be preferred as it keeps the alignment of the list elements. Perhaps we can add it as a known issue/ warning to users who are trying to insert custom css stylesheets into their documents?

I also came across this [thread ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10428720/how-to-keep-indent-for-second-line-in-ordered-lists-via-css)on stack overflow where the accepted answer suggested using the browser's table layout algorithm to achieve the same effect. I've tried it out and it does preserve the outside property and keeps the indentation while avoiding the hidden list numbers.

@CYX22222003 Ahh okay thanks for explaining how it works. 

Should the url change according to the filter settings be more intuitive in this case? Are there any upsides to keeping the param hash of the previous search result as compared to just applying it to every new search result? Since as a user, I would expect the selected settings to still be applied to my search results.

### MarkBind version

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

When browsing through the user guide for adding mcq quesitons, I chanced upon a section that allows for multiple correct mcq questions.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0c458ff-8c6a-4da4-a2cd-e1ea3488f3ff)

The source code for the question is reproduced below: 

```
<question type="mcq" header="Which of these **contradicts** the heuristics recommended when creating test cases with multiple inputs?">
  &gt;!-- Insert the reason for the option using the reason attribute -->
  <q-option reason="This is **correct**. We need to figure out if a positive test case works!">
    Each valid test input should appear at least once in a test case that doesn’t have any invalid inputs.
  </q-option>
  <q-option>
    It is ok to combine valid values for different inputs.
  </q-option>
  <q-option>
    No more than one invalid test input should be in a given test case.
  </q-option>
  &gt;!-- Use the 'correct' attribute to indicate an option as correct. -->
  <q-option correct>
    All invalid test inputs must be tested together.
    &gt;!-- Optionally, you may use a reason slot instead of a reason attribute. -->
    <div slot="reason">
    If you test all invalid test inputs together, you will not know if each one of the invalid inputs are handled
    correctly by the SUT.
    This is because most SUTs return an error message upon encountering the first invalid input.
    </div>
  </q-option>
  <div slot="hint">
  How do you figure out which inputs are wrong? (or correct)
  </div>
</question>
```

The first option is indicated as a correct option but lacks `correct` as a parameter

### Expected behavior

According to the tip below, mcqs can have multiple correct answers. Does that mean that the first option would need to be correct as well?

I noticed in the source code above that the first option is not indicated as a correct option. 

A sample of how to the correct output is shown below (ignore the qn in the heading):

I agree that this would be better if it was rephrased.


> 2. Provide another example of a question with multiple correct options.

Would it be better if this was left as a tip instead? Though allowed, according to proper heuristics, if there are multiple correct answers, users should choose to use a checkbox question instead of a multiple choice question.

Thanks for sharing your perspective. I see your point about MCQ and Checkbox questions serving different purposes, especially in cases where flexibility in grading is desired. 

Given that the original concern stemmed from potential ambiguity in the tip, I agree that we should ensure clarity and should go along with adding an example to avoid ambiguity while still showing that it is possible to do so.

> When I initially suggested the feature [here](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2648#issuecomment-2756926293), I was actually thinking of a component attribute for the cardstack component's main filtering (e.g. `&lt;cardstack searchable blocks="2" logic="AND">`).

I agree your suggestion is sound. We should go with the `logic` attribute taking on the options of `AND`, `OR` and `BOTH` and in the last case of `BOTH`, a toggle for switiching between them would appear in the component.

 A concern that I have with this is that readers could be confused with the filter feature of the tags with no indication of whether the filter should be an AND/ OR filter. But I think we should leave this up to the choice of the user creating the site.

I presume you mean the case of whether this should apply to all card stack components that appear in the site or the indicidual card stack components. If that is the case, then we should make it apply to individual card stack components, preferably stated as an attribute. For example, `&lt;cardstack searchable blocks="2" logic="or">`

`BOTH` means we include both AND and OR search into the card stack component. Essentially showing the button to toggle between AND/ OR search.

I agree with this. A visible checkbox would defitnitely improve reader's knowledge about the current search feature logic. I think we should go with prof @damithc suggestion to maintain a visible checkbox. @lhw-1 Any thoughts on this?

I was thinking maybe a dropdown in between the searh bar and the start of the first tag. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to share them and we can look at it as well.

Right now the cards of the card stack component defaults to a default white background. It would be good if users can specify custom colors for the background of the card stack component as well as the individual cards to enhance user experience and increase customizability.


### Describe the solution you'd like

Perhaps custom colours can be specified as an attribute of the `card` component. Other alternative solutions are welcome as well. 


### Describe alternatives you've considered
We should explore the idea of specifying custom colours as well as predefined set of colour combinations to see which is better suited to provide for users.

> [@Incogdino](https://github.com/Incogdino) How about the background colour of the stack (i.e., the container)? Perhaps allow changing that as well?

Yup agree that we should support that as well. I'm considering if we should leave the colour combination up to the users or provide a set of colour combinations that will not cause the card stack component to look off.

Maybe the former option is better since it leaves the choice up to the user? Or maybe we can support both as well.

Add custom ids to cards of the card stack component so that it can be defined elsewhere. This will improve reusability in cases where the card contain useful information and can be easily included.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Something similar to Markbind's [include](https://markbind.org/userGuide/reusingContents.html#includes) syntax to allow for cards to be imported easily to any part of the document.

I think a popover would better suit the needs of this enhancement instead of a popup since a popup might require users to explicitly close it. 

Also, I was thinking if it would be good to have a popover that appears when hovered indicating the action of the button. This is because although the copy button might be intuitive, the text wrap button might not be very intuitive to readers.

I also want to add that there is a minor documentation link issue at the end of the "Migrating to TypeScript" page where it links to the Project Structure instead of "Migrating Node.js". Would perhaps be good if this can be updated alongside the documentation as well.

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 06 02:57:30]%%

After spending some time investigating the issue, I noted that the most likely cause of the issue was due to the `overflow:hidden` property in `main.css`. However, a larger issue lies in `ol` and `ul`.

Inspecting the 2103 website on safari and chrome on macOS and adding custom list elements, I get this result:

<img width="2560" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0433b1ca-1452-427c-a524-9f9971acaecf" />

- Tested with list of 9 elements and 10 elements
- In the safari browser, the tenth place is totally hidden by the `overflow:hidden` property 
- In the chrome browser, the 1 of the tenth place is actually partially hidden away as it slightly flows out of the content area and gets hidden


Implications:
- Removing `overflow:hidden` is likely not going to be a long term solution as it might be needed for some use cases.
- Having > 100 elements in the list (though uncommon) will hide away the hundredth place in both safari and chrome browsers as shown below (going from 99th element to 100th element in chrome browser on macOS): 
<img width="530" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1bf8a92-f156-43a3-a267-3da4f19e9961" />

Looking into `markbind.css` and `bootstrap.css`:
- `padding-left: 1.5rem` sets a padding of 24px but for tenth place to properly shows, it needs at least 32px.
- By default, `ol` and `ul` uses `list-style-position: outside` which right-aligns the list numbers
- `bootstrap.css` also specifies a 32px `padding-left` to `ol` and `ul` and so lists that are >100 do not display their hundredth place 

Potential solutions: 
1. Change to `list-style-position: inside` which will left-align the list numbers while preserving `padding-left: 1.5rem`. This displays the numbers starting from the largest position as shown below. However, the drawback would be that the start of text would gradually be off skewed as the list number increases as noted by the start of the 10th postion.

- Solution should keep indentation reasonable, especially for mobile devices (#1669)

> Some possible tweaks to the search feature:
> 
> 1. Omit tags from search, as there is already a better mechanism to filter by tags?

My opinion is that the more search parameters in the search field, the better the search result. In this case, I feel that adding tags to the search field can help improve on search efficiency. Though polluting the search space with too many parameters can also make search results inefficient.

In this case, I think searching by tags is still necessary in the case where we have many tags and using the tag filter feature can be slightly cumbersome? I'm comparing the search feature to applications like stackoverflow where tag search is part of their search bar as well. 

> 2. Include card body in the search? This allows easy search even when keywords or a header are not provided (most likely keywords will be a rarely used feature, used only when the user wants to support search by synonyms or when the body does not have text).

I agree, this will defitnitely improve the search feature greatly and improve the search result as well. Something I have in mind is we could also incoporate text highlighting like our in built search feature to improve user readability.

This is likely due to the migration to vue 3.

```
      const labelText = labelSlotContent?.[0]?.children?.[0]?.text;
      const labelHeader = headerSlotContent?.[0]?.children?.[0]?.text;
```

Updating these lines to this should work:

```
      const labelText = labelSlotContent?.[0]?.children;
      const labelHeader = headerSlotContent?.[0]?.children;

Tests for portfolio view needed the `--portfolio` flag enabled (or `isPortfolio: true` in `summary.json`), hence the changes to the gradle tasks and vite config. Unfortunately, this means report is generated twice now (once without `--portfolio` flag, once with) and takes slightly longer to setup.

I considered having separate tasks for each view (`cypressDefault`, `cypressPortfolio`, `frontendTestDefault`, `frontendTestPortfolio`) but I think having all the tests available like how it is currently is more convenient.

If anyone has any opinions, please feel free to suggest!

Will continue changes from #2303 for #2283 here.

**Default view:** Frontend follows existing behavior as custom repository time periods are not supported in this view.

**Portfolio view:** Displayed summary charts to be unaffected by filter dates, solely relying on the date ranges in `summary.json`. No longer need to consider interaction with filter dates. Trim timeline will still be allowed.

@jonasongg That's a good idea, I think the first option makes more sense so will try that first. Would it be better to do those refactoring changes together in another refactoring PR that Ryan suggested?

Yeah would be better to. This PR assumes the `summary.json` is correct (ie. repository custom date range always present when `isPortfolio: true`, and never present otherwise) and works without it assuming correct config.

Due to how the `pull_request_target` trigger runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the context of the merge commit, getting the failing check (`.github/workflows/pending.yml`) to pass is not possible within PRs (to my knowledge). 

This problem is only possible because previously passing checks auto-fail after 2025-01-30 due to the [deprecation](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/). Can we make an exception to merge this in? 

Future runs of the workflow should pass after merging this in as the base of the PRs for those runs would have the updated `pending.yml` workflow.

Wait I was just asking if that is a constraint, not sure if it's supposed to be one.

I was mainly wondering what would be the intended behavior if `--since` & `--until` CLI flags are provided and are before and after the min and max of all repos' `sinceDate` and `untilDate` respectively. Is allowing this necessary for anything? Can't think of anything atm.

If allowed, will the commits in `commits.json` still only be limited to the individual repo's `sinceDate` and `untilDate`?

Thanks for the backend changes!

Left some minor nits regarding naming. 

Also, I think tests for the changes in RepoConfiguration may be missing? Would be good to ascertain default values if `hasUpdatedSinceDateInConfig` and `hasUpdatedUntilDateInConfig` are false, and if the commits are filtered correctly according to the individual repo's date ranges.

Should update docs for the new fields too.

Yes, following the call stack, the previous `Repo` type was wrong and should be `User` instead. 

Naming was very confusing to begin with, maybe we can fix this in another PR for refactoring and cleanup. I'm worried changing parts of it now may make it even more confusing.

> what if `summary.json` specifies A to B, and i filter C to D?

Thanks for catching the 2nd case, I didn't consider that. Sorry for the oversight, will fix and add the tests for more edge cases

Here's what's I intend, do lmk if there's smth btr:

Let's say
A: 2020-01-01
B: 2021-01-01
C: 2022-01-01
D: 2023-01-01

If summary.json specifies A - D and you filter B - C, it should show B - C (the tightest range possible). Currently working.

If summary.json specifies A - C and you filter B - D, it should show B - C (the tightest range possible). Currently working.

If summary.json specifies A - B and you filter C - D, it should show B - B. Currently unaccounted.

If summary.json specifies C - D and you filter A - B, it should show C - C. Currently unaccounted.

As discussed on Monday, custom repository time periods will only be supported in portfolio view mode, due to its intended use case.

Here will be the intended behavior:

**Default view:** Disallow / ignore custom repository time periods (#2334). Frontend follows existing behavior as custom repository time periods are not supported in this view.

**Portfolio view:** Displayed summary charts to be unaffected by filter dates, solely relying on the date ranges in `summary.json`. No longer need to consider interaction with filter dates. Trim timeline will still be allowed.

I'll make these FE changes in #2320 and close this PR as the changes are interdependent.

---

For future reference, in case supporting custom repository time periods in default view becomes needed (non-exhaustive):

1. Decide how custom repository time periods should interact with the filter dates. 
a. Intersection of the 2 date ranges likely requires changes to adjust selectable filter dates to make sure all custom repository date ranges are included.
b. Ignore filter dates and only display the custom repository date range if provided. Backend needs to add a field to indicate if custom repository date range was provided.
c. Union and filter date range priority does not seem to make sense as commits may seem missing.
2. Consider what should be displayed when grouped by author

The default descending sorting doesn't seem to be working. Both default and default descending is sorting in the same order (screenshots below). I also don't see any logic handling the descending case. 

Also, I think would be good to include cypress tests for these types of changes.

Default:

Seems like currently, the global since and until takes into account the default since and until dates as well. If we don't provide CLI until, we're getting a global range of earliest commit to today (default value of until). 

Not sure if that's intended, but I don't think it breaks functionality. Would be good to clarify this doc if it was intended.

Just for consideration: `findGlobalUntilDate` & `findGlobalSinceDate` methods seems like it should only be looking at repo configurations if either of the CLI dates not provided, but seems like we are still getting the CLI dates.

Is there a need to remove this behavior? This is replacing the d1 date (1970-01-01) with earliest since date from the repos. Probably the reason you had to change the systemtests' since dates as well as the cyress tests.

If intended, could you verify that it's consistent (check places that use `isEqualToArbitraryFirstDate*`) and update this behavior in the following?
* `./docs/ug/cli.md`: Under --since, there's a part on d1 behavior
* `./src/main/java/reposense/parser/types/SinceDateArgumentType.java`: Comments

### Please include the steps to reproduce the bug.

Run any GitHub Actions workflow that uses v3 of actions/upload-artifact or actions/download-artifact.

### What was expected to happen?

Workflows should run.

### What actually happened? Please include a screenshot of the output.

` Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`. Learn more: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/`

### Proposed solution

Migrate actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact to v4.

[Deprecation notice: v3 of the artifact actions](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/)

Alternatively, within `summary.json` or a separate file, more fine-grained configuration to control whether each individual input field should be rendered by the frontend. May be better for more customization on how the portfolio would look like.

### Tell us about your environment

* **RepoSense Version:** -
* **OS and Version:** MacOS
* **Web Browser and Version (if applicable):** Firefox

### Please include the steps to reproduce the bug.

1. On a ramp, select a tight range around a commit. The zoom view sometimes do not include the commit.
1. Select a range that touches the edge. The zoom view usually does not include the end dates.

This happens more often when "trim timeline" is enabled.

### What was expected to happen?

When the selected range on the on the ramp shows that a commit is within the range, we expect that commit to be within the zoom range. By extension, we assume the selected points convert to dates proportionally to the width of the ramp.

### What actually happened? Please include a screenshot of the output.

Even though the commit is clearly within the selected range on the left, it is not included in the zoom view on the right.

Similarly, even though the selected range reaches the end of the ramp, the zoom date range does not include the end date.

Due to supporting the new portfolio mode, a new `c-summary-portfolio.vue` component was created. Currently, there is quite a bit of duplicated code in `c-summary.vue` and `c-summary-portfolio.vue`, namely error message boxes, functions and styles. It may become difficult to manage as we may need to update both for future changes.

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->
Refactor common parts (eg. error message boxes, functions and styles) into separate reusable components. 

Conditional dates in `c-summary-charts.vue` are also getting complicated. Let's simplify this too.

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered

&lt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.

If we decide that the portfolio view will not diverge further than the default view (apart from minor visual changes), may consider combining the 2 components into 1. Would still be good to refactor as it is getting difficult to add new changes.

With the recent addition of the `portfolio` mode of the report, we now have 2 different modes of the report. The previously existing Cypress tests only run on the `default` mode. There is an entirely different set of Cypress tests for the `portfolio` mode.

This is not ideal as we expect some of the existing functionalities to work the same way on both modes, but is currently not being tested for the `portfolio` mode.

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--

I propose refactoring the Cypress tests into:
* `cypress/tests/common`: Majority of the older tests should for under here and ran on both report modes. 
* `cypress/tests/default`: For `default` exclusive behavior.
* `cypress/tests/portfolio`: For `portfolio` exclusive behavior.

This would make tests easier to maintain while ensuring better test coverage of the `portfolio` mode.

Now that custom sort order (follows initial order of rows in `repo-config.csv`) has been added in #2331, it would be better for portfolio mode to use that ordering instead of the current sort by ascending group name.

Reasoning is that there is currently no way for the user (portfolio creator) to specify the order of the repositories in portfolio mode. It would be better for the user to be able to customize the order through the config file, so they can put more important / recent projects at the top.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 28 00:18:19]%%

The reason we decided to revert the custom date range for default view was that the main intended use case that was discussed for them was the portfolio view, while supporting it for default view caused a lot of weird cases that needed to be handled on the FE.

I think if we disallow illegal date range that falls outside on the BE, the FE complications that we had previously should be manageable. 

We just need to decide on how should the filter since and until dates in the form interact with the custom date range and merge and consider if any of the side effect may seem misleading or too complicated:

1. Intersection: Possible. We will display warning if they do not intersect. With merging groups, it seems misleading to me as it might seem like there are missing commits from the ramp when it is actually because of those commits being out of range for that repository, with no indication of it. Could be a non-issue if the user strictly only cares about the specified date range.
2. Specified custom data ranges ignores filter: Complicated and unintuitive. Particularly with merging groups, we can get strange date indicators outside what is input in the filter dates in the form.
3. Union: Again strange date indicators outside what is input in the filter dates in form.
4. Filter dates in form takes priority: Also seems misleading to me due to seemingly missing commits, this time even outside merging groups. But again, depends on how you see it.

Overall, I think FE shouldn't have much issues implementing if we can decide on the intended behavior for above. I suggest adding support for custom date range in default view to be implemented as a separate issue as this simplified behavior would fulfil its intended use case for portfolio view while keeping default view unaffected.

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 28 01:02:11]%%

Yep I understand what Si Kai is suggesting and I agree that filter range taking priority (as current behavior) makes the most sense coming from the POV that report generators want to exclude certain commits and viewers should not care about any outside the range. 

Just for consideration, the case that I thought might be misleading to viewers was tracking something like IP (Week 1-6) and TP (Week 7-13). If a student makes a commit to IP after week 6, maybe due to extension, that commit might seem missing to the viewer (student) without knowledge of the configuration. There are ofc simple workarounds to mitigate this like having buffers etc, but just wanted to point out how it may be misleading in rare cases.

Also, if we're going with the filter range priority for default view, can I confirm that in portfolio mode, it should be handled differently and the date indicators displayed are the individual repository date ranges (as how it is implemented in #2340)?

Yes, it will use the date specified by `--since` and `--until` flag. If the flag is not provided, it will use the default dates.

The `hasUpdatedSinceDateTime` and `hasUpdateUntilDateTime` are the flags to determine whether should use the default dates or not.

> LGTM. Probably don't need a local search bar for globs anymore since we already have a global one. A good starting point as it integrates a global search bar for globs. Full requirements may need another PR as code panel is currently used to display 1 repository only, and changes to include all repositories can be potentially complex.

Thanks for the review!

I think the issue currently does not explicitly require display all documents in one code panel. But it may be a good feature to discuss for the future development. 

Moreover, I think that whether to remove the local search is a good issue for discussion. Maybe we still want to keep the local search bar for each ramp. There may be a case where users are not comparing across repos but just trying to find a local glob.

Regarding the changes, I think this implementation is satisfied with the current requirements. The idea of displaying all relevant blobs in a single page is a possible feature we can discuss about.

It is a bit hard to find a place to insert the tooltip with another icon and all other search fields doesn't seem to have tooltip embedded. Any suggestions?

While testing this on my forked repo, it generates a blank preview website, which is likely to be caused by #2289.

The lighthouse CI successfully detects the blank scripts and the preview check is not passed.

I will wait for #2300 to be merged then proceed to further testing. 

The log information for testing:

The current implementation uses `pages-gem` image to set up the `jekyll` environment for github pages deployment and attempt to deploy the dashboard.

Lighthouse CI is then used to audit the URL of locally deployed website.  

The sample CI test log is available here: https://github.com/CYX22222003/RepoSense/actions/runs/13437498224/job/37543263823

> @CYX22222003 I agree that we could add more test for the blurb's frontend. Do you think working together on PR #2339 is better? As there is some minor modification in some code naming and also updates on the json files. Or would you want to update them accordingly in this current PR?

Sure, I think i can add changes to PR #2339. I will set up a local branch to track the relevant PR and try to make changes there. For this PR, I would like to keep this open for now as a reference.

I agree that the main factors affecting the time is the cloning and generating JSON. The time for parsing of CSV file may not be so significant compared to these two. The current implementation has done well in avoiding unnecessary re-execution of these two jobs and reducing the time for rerunning the program after small changes. Hence, a change to avoid parsing may not be as important as the current implementation.

However, a change should not be that complicated. I try to insert below code before running of `getRepoConfigurations` and it runs OK. Basically, just parse the blurb and write the JSON file and zip file before even parsing the CSV config. This is because the generated `configs` and `reportConfig` of parsing CSV or stand-alone config is actually not being used when re-updating the JSON file and zip files.

```
            blurbMap = cliArguments.getBlurbMap();

            if (cliArguments.isOnlyTextRefreshed()) ``{``
                Path summaryJsonPath = Paths.get(cliArguments.getOutputFilePath().toAbsolutePath().toString()
                        + "/" + SummaryJson.SUMMARY_JSON_FILE_NAME);
                if (!Files.exists(summaryJsonPath)) ``{``
                    throw new IOException("summary.json does not exist in the output folder. Aborting report generation.");
                ``}``
                SummaryJson updatedSummaryJson = SummaryJson.updateSummaryJson(summaryJsonPath, blurbMap,
                        formatter.format(ZonedDateTime.now(cliArguments.getZoneId())),
                        TimeUtil.getElapsedTime());

                FileUtil.writeJsonFile(updatedSummaryJson, cliArguments.getOutputFilePath().toAbsolutePath().toString()
                        + "/" + SummaryJson.SUMMARY_JSON_FILE_NAME);

                FileUtil.addOrReplaceFileInZipFile(
                        cliArguments.getOutputFilePath().toAbsolutePath(),
                        cliArguments.getOutputFilePath().toAbsolutePath(),
                        SummaryJson.SUMMARY_JSON_FILE_NAME,
                        FileUtil.ZIP_FILE);

                logger.info(TimeUtil.getElapsedTimeMessage());
                if (cliArguments.isAutomaticallyLaunching()) ``{``
                    ReportServer.startServer(SERVER_PORT_NUMBER, cliArguments.getOutputFilePath().toAbsolutePath());
                ``}``
                return;
            ``}``
``` 

This further reduced the time taken to generate report compared to my previous experiment (which is 0.72s). Not sure whether the benefit will be more significant if the size of CSV file increases.

If this is not so significant, we should leave it aside and just get the current implementation to be merged.

This PR indeed reduce the time for repeatedly cloning and analyzing repos after rerun. LGTM

When I looked at the logger information, it seems that the rerun is still triggering the parsing the CSV config file. Is this the expected behavior? I suppose it should just copy the `title.md` and update the `blurbMap` of the `summary.json`.

Actually is it really necessary to use different key name for each of the blurb map? Maybe use the same name such as `blurbMap` can reduce the need to override the parsing in each specific blurb parser since they are just doing the same thing. This may better follow the DRY.

It is unlikely that the the format of blurb map to change.

Customized since date and until date using CSV config should only be allowed in the `portfolio` mode. Under non-portfolio mode, the since date and until date will used the default one or the one specified by `--since` and `--until` flags.

There is a conflict between the date range filter and the dates specified in CSV (hardcoded dates). There may be a case which repos specified hardcoded time ranges that are non-overlapping and far away from one another. 

It is a bit hard to make sure the date range is consistent with the widely spread ranges. Therefore, we decide to restrict the hardcoded dates to portfolio mode. Under portfolio mode, the date range filter will be disable. 

There is a discussion abut this problem in issue #2303 

Anything to add on? @Airiinnn @jonasongg @sopa301

> My thinking is, there is no need to make the two consistent with each other. We consider the two ways of specifying the range as _default-with-override_. That is, if hard-coded start/end is given for a repo, we use that for that repo (i.e., we consider it as an _override_). If there is no hard-coded start/end given, we use the since/until specified via CLI flags as start/end (i.e., we consider it as the _default_ to fall back on). So, it will same as we copy-pasted CLI since/until values to all repos that don't have hard-coded start/end. And, there will be no issue of 'illegal' date ranges.
> 
> However, I'm fine with not supporting both at the same time too -- it will be a very rare use case anyway. So, go with whichever the option that results in the simpler implementation.

That's the current behavior of the hard-coded start/end dates. If the user didn't specify the dates for either start or end in the CSV config, the backend will use the default since date or until date (either the ones specified by `--since` and `--until` flags or the one-month default period) for the respective repo configuration.

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 28 09:37:26]%%

In conclusion, there are several ways to redefine how the CSV config is using (correct me if I am wrong):
1. Limit the CSV date range to a subset of default date range (ones specified by flags or the default one month). Throw an error when the
2. Set overall earliest start date and latest end date for `summary.json`'s based on CSV config and default dates. Keep the current behavior on how each repo's date range is specified.

The BE should not have too much difficulty to handle both cases. If the FE is picking the correct info from the `summary.json`, the filter and the date range of each ramp should be consistent

So which approach should we choose?

> Let's go with having the CSV file define the range of commits to fetch per repo. This way, we can avoid massive changes to frontend logic and allow our portfolio PR to proceed. So the behaviour will be as such per repo:
> 
> 1. CSV line present, CLI present: Range of commits will be taken from CSV line, and CSV line will be validated against CLI line.
> 2. CSV line present, CLI absent: Range of commits taken from CSV line. Overall range is the union of all ranges across CSV-specified repos.
> 3. CSV line absent (already implemented): Range of commits taken from CLI (if any, else default values for CLI)
> 
> Behaviour for the other views (e.g. Author, Chart, None) should remain the same since this is a backend change.

I have some questions regarding the suggestions. For case 1 and case 2, how to handle the case where only one of the `--since` flag and `--until` flag is provided. Furthermore, do we need to consider the existence of `--period` flag?

Another alternative implementation to handle the conflict between CLI and CSV dates is to set CSV dates has higher priority. The outer `sinceDate` and `untilDate` fields of `summary.json` (which should be the ones used for FE date range selector) will be the earliest start date and the latest end date of all repos. The CLI/default dates will be used if the CSV date is not provided.

Additional checks will be made for following cases cause potential conflicts:
1) CSV since date after CSV until date
2) CSV since date after CLI/default until date, CSV until date not provided
3) CSV until date before CLI/default since date, CSV since date not provided
4) CLI since date after CLI until date

This kindof gives users more choices as now they can choose to use CSV to restrict range of commits, or just want to use it to customize the result of certain repos?

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->
When any PR or changes that have been made on main repo, we want to trigger a workflow that will test the whole report-generation logic at the `publish-Reposense` with the new changes. This is to detect early regression.

Work done in #2295 explores the use of `lighthouse CLI` to detect possible blank pages due to possible routing issues. 

To fully solve the issue, we may need to integrate the techniques to trigger workflow in another repository with Github Actions ([ref](https://medium.com/hostspaceng/triggering-workflows-in-another-repository-with-github-actions-4f581f8e0ceb))

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->

Some ideas on possible implementation:
1) The event will trigger a POST request to the relevant API that will trigger the workflow in `publish-Reposense`, the request's payload should contain information such as PR number or commit hash.
2) `publish-Reposense` need to check out to the correct version of main repo jar file using the payload through running the downloading utility scripts.
3) Set up `jekyll` building environment to run github pages on `publish-Reposense`'s github action runner
4) Deploy the website on github action runner
5) Use Lighthouse CLI to audit the website, it will exit with error when the page is blank.

Currently, the `tabs-pane` can only show one `code panel` and it is displayed when user clock on the relevant icon in a chart under the `summary` section.

To give a better way to compare a subset of file, we should give users the ability to stack over multiple code panel in the tabs pane section. With the global filter search key words specified in the `summary`, it will be much easier for users to visualize all files that contain the keyword at the tabs pane section.

The current Netlify deployment guide for the dashboard is somewhat static and only provides a script that sets up the Java 11 environment. While the script works out of the box, it lacks detailed explanations of each step. This may leave users unsure about the functionality behind each command and how they might need to modify the script for their own projects or unique requirements. Hence, it will be better if more concise comments can be added to explain what each command does and highlight parts that can be modified.

How about putting the `assets` folder under the `configs` directory? As such, user does not need to use additional flag to specify the assets file. Otherwise, two copy actions need to be implemented to move `favicon.ico` from `assets` and `title.md` from `configs` separately.

What I am proposing is to manually install and set the default java environment at the netlify server using the `netlify.toml` and I have tested with my [fork repo](https://github.com/reposense/publish-RepoSense/pull/15). But I am not sure whether this approach is desirable in terms of efficiency.

I see. Maybe we should update the relevant part of user guide only. Since deploying to Netlify is just one of many options of uploading, modifying the publish-RepoSense seems to be redundant and may confuse users.

Simply change the `registerTypeAdapter` to `registerTypeHierarchyAdapter` for `LocalDateTime` and `ZoneId` will resolve the issue.

One of the tools we can potentially use to audit the website is [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action).

Furthermore, it may be possible to use docker images such as [pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) or [stareforssen/docker-github-pages](https://github.com/Starefossen/docker-github-pages) to emulate the build environment for github pages.

Currently, this is not a urgent issue as this test is only needed when we change the build system which is unlikely to be frequent.

I compared the log information between past successful builds and recent failed builds. It seems to be caused by the change in default value of `allow_forks` from `false` to `true`. Maybe we have to add this attribute mannually.

We can change the existing condition to `(github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master') || github.event_name == 'schedule'`

This is the result on my local fork.

### If possible, describe the solution
In terms of the function code the only thing should be changing is the one in the `RepoConfigCsvParser.java`. Currently, the since date and until date are taken in the format of `dd/MM/yyyy` and then hardcoded into valid `LocalDatetime` object by manually adding the default since date start time and default until date end time.

A way to solve this issue is to relax the constraint on the format of date time input in the CSV. We can support both `dd/MM/yyyy` and `dd/MM/yyyyTHH:mm` at the same time. Only hardcoding and overwriting the dates is specific time is not provided.

It will be suitable for first-comer to work on this so that they can get a rough idea of how the arguments are parsed and the repos are analyzed from the experience of implementing this one.

@lyuanww I merge your branch to #2340 and the test cases are still failing when I run it locally (Windows, Java 11). 
Here is the error message

Thanks for pointing out this potential feature flaw!

The repos to condense is determine by the URL field `mergeGroup`. The param hash will associate a list of repo urls which should be included in the dashboard display. And after entering the search keyword, the param hash should remain constant other than the `search` field.

Based on my investigation if the user filter then merge the group, only the filtered repos will be condensed (in this case only repos with "W13-3" is actually merged). When user continue to filter another repo, the hash `mergeGroup` will not be updated. Hence, the new filtered file with keyword "W13-4" will not be condensed.

Here is the URL after searching for "W13-3"
```
https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=W13-3&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2025-02-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=AY2425S2-CS2103T-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false
```

Here is the URL after searching for "W13-4"
```
https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=W13-4&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2025-02-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=AY2425S2-CS2103T-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false
```

May be we can further discussion on how to improve the behavior of merging and filtering repos?

> [@CYX22222003](https://github.com/CYX22222003) Ahh okay thanks for explaining how it works.
> 
> Should the url change according to the filter settings be more intuitive in this case? Are there any upsides to keeping the param hash of the previous search result as compared to just applying it to every new search result? Since as a user, I would expect the selected settings to still be applied to my search results.

To clarify the previous search result is not kept, only the `mergeGroup` result is kept. And this field actually will be persistent even if you clear the search field. It seems that the current behavior of merging all groups just make an attempt to update the current filtered group and update the hash. 

I think the suggestion by @Incogdino indeed has a good point. A possible way is to keep the setting for merged setting in a Boolean variable and pass it around using URL hash. So every time can update the `merged groups` in `c-summary.vue` based on its existing values and the flag.

However, I am not sure whether this implementation will conflict with any current implementation or violate any assumptions and principles.

@sopa301 @jonasongg @joeng03 @Airiinnn Any idea about this issue?

Thank you for pointing this out! Do you mean to abstract them down in abstract class?

Sure I can update the documentation! About the learning curve I saw relevant discussion on the issue that I linked too. I agree with Marcus opinion that it might be a bit ambiguous for developer that are unfamiliar to Vue, but the learning curve is not steep. Updating this also align with the Vue guide to use shorthand syntax for better code quality, and I agree that is a good practice for new developer like me myself to adapt to it early.

Alright that sounds good for me! At the same time I would also develop the chart blurb and see if there is any abstraction or refractoring that could done as some of the backend code is slightly repetitive. Thanks for working on the front end!

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

Shared some suggestion for updating the UG. Also I reformat the proposed commit message because some of the lines are truncated with very few characters before the next word.

'''Support datetime (previously just date) for since and until in both
Backend and Frontend.

3 supported formats for since and until dates: 
1. DD/MM/YYYY
2. DD/MM/YYYY'T'HH:mm
3. DD/MM/YYYY'T'HH:mm:ss

For example:
`./gradlew run -Dargs="--since 31/12/2017T10:10"`


Rationale for using 'T' instead of blank space is to adhere to ISO
8601 format and prevent complicating the CLI input where it will need
an additional set of quotation marks to identify the space-separated
date.

Behavior: For since date, if hour/minute/seconds not supplied then
default to 0 for each. For until date, if hour/minute/seconds not 
supplied then default to 23, 59, 59 respectively. If only one date
(since or until) is provided, and a period is also provided (default
to 1 month in our existing project), the time of since is truncated
to 00:00:00 if until is supplied, and time of until is truncated to 
23:59:59 if since is supplied.


Note for systemtest: For "Asia/Singapore" timezone, on dates before
01-01-1982, where Singapore and Malaysia switched from UTC+07:30
to UTC+08:00, all date conversions will result in +7.5 hours instead
of +8 hours. For example, the Unix epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 will be 
1970-01-01 07:30:00 with "Asia/Singapore" timezone, but 
1970-01-01 08:00:00 with "UTC+08" timezone.
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B07:30.

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 03 14:02:54]%%

The publish-reposense CI/CD pipeline is not running automatically on updates or events. After reviewing the configuration, it seems the issue stems from the updated code in PR [[#2252] Enable CI Checks on PRs and Restrict Deployment to Master](https://github.com/reposense/publish-RepoSense/pull/20), which included the condition:

`if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'`

### What was expected to happen?

The pipeline should run automatically for all relevant events.

### Possible solution
The condition `if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'` can be removed or updated.

### Please include the steps to reproduce the bug.
When running test cases for the author and chart blurb, you can find out that when multiple blurb is in the markdown, the order of the blurb is parsed is not as how it is expected.

### What was expected to happen?
We will expect the blurb to be parse following the order in the `summary.json` (blurb 1 -&gt; blurb 2 -&gt; blurb 3)
But now repo blurb are parsing in order of (2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3) and chart in (3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1) which is unexpected. This does not actually affecting the project as the order of the blurb is parsed is not important, but it would be nice if the reason that affect the parsing order.

### What actually happened? Please include a screenshot of the output.
May refer to the `summary.json` files in the system test and look for the field of author blurb and chart blurb to see the orders.

Hi Prof @damithc, since we currently group the commits by dates, and each date has multiple commits, we can't do filtering based on datetime as of now. Should we changed the structure of `authorDailyContributionsMap` to support this?

Will be slightly challenging to test since in the buggy version, the elements are still there, just that it’s not displaying. 

Suggest to merge this first, then discuss how to filter by commit datetime instead of just date. Then, more tests could be added for the correct display of ramps.

Hi @ckcherry23, sorry for the oversight! I just committed the logo.png file for RepoSense. I can now see the logo in the deployed preview.

Hi @sopa301, just added a cypress test for the entire flow of copying iframe through a button, going to the widget mode URL, and detecting the existence of the logo.

> Just a clarification about an edge case: when it is group by author, what is the sorting order of case like ``{``[1], [1], [1, 2], [1]``}`` ? This may be common in the case of CS2103T tp where more than one coder has the same order.


After looking into it, I realized that several other sorting options also face the same issue where there is no defined order if the values have a tie, for example, when grouped by repo, sort the groups by author displayName (there is a possible case where an author contributed to multiple repos, and is the lexicographically largest display name among contributors of both repos.

I would propose to resolve this ambiguity in another PR, where each grouping option (by author or repo) can only sort by a fixed set of fields (for example, sort by default order might not make sense for group by author, and sort by author displayName might not make sense for group by repo). Then for sort fields that might have the same value (for example, totalCommits might be the same for several authors/repos), maybe define a default way to break ties (for example, the default ordering of repos, or lexicogaphical order of author displayName.

 there is no need to declare implements `BlurbMarkdownParser` in `AuthorBlurbMarkdownParser` and `RepoBlurbMarkdownParser` because they already extend from MarkdownParser&lt;T>.

Hi @JHyeon0915, thanks for your contribution!

Could you also review the codebase for other instances of similar code quality issues, such as magic numbers/strings, complex conditionals, and opportunities for better abstraction or encapsulation? Identifying these areas will help us consolidate code-quality improvements of the entire codebase within this PR.

Looking forward to your insights!

Currently, we have this warning when building the Vite frontend:

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.

Optimizations can be done to cut down the chunk size to reduce the size of files we have to load to the frontend, potentially improving performance.

Highlight.js occupies around 862.99kB of size, but the largest chunks of it belong to languages that are very rarely used. Propose to remove these languages (like Mathematica) from the default built, and add them only if the config files specify that this language needs to be supported.

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 29 03:52:23]%%

Repos are not sorted correctly by their titles when grouped by authors.

When grouping by authors and sorting within groups by title in descending order, the first group should list **reposense/RepoSense[cypress]** before **reposense/publish-RepoSense[master]**, following the lexicographical order of the lowercased titles. However, the observed order is incorrect, as shown below.  

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306aaff7-b988-4a1a-a72f-06b6794ac364)

This suggests that the test case **'group by authors works with show tags'** in **frontend/cypress/tests/chartView/chartView_showTags.cy.js** is not correctly validating the sorting behavior, as it passes despite the incorrect order. The sorting logic should be corrected and the test should be revised to ensure it accurately checks for the expected lexicographical sorting.

LLM-powered automated code reviews can potentially help us discover bugs/issues that we might have missed, and also auto fix obvious code quality issues so that reviewers can focus more on the functionality and improvements. Have to verify whether our open source project fulfills GitHub's criteria for free Copilot, or if we can apply for free access, or explore other solutions like [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-code-review-action). Can even build one ourselves to leverage on free LLM APIs/models(fun side project?).


Currently, we can access Copilot but have to prompt it manually to review the code. Will be good if this is integrated into the CI/CD workflow for more accurate and faster reviews.

For CLI, it will be a good enhancement for user experience to support formats like 2020-12-11 00:30, where we can also accept a blank space instead of 'T' as a separator, which is more intuitive. However, some investigation is needed to handle the CLI inputs correctly, because we might need an additional set of quotation marks to identify the entire space-separated date from other arguments, but if we use an inner '' and an outer "", current code parses the date as '2020-12-11 00:30, with an additional ' in front, which is incorrect.

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 03 15:52:47]%%

Related to #2331 

Several sorting options face the issue where there is no defined order if the sort values have a tie, for example, when grouped by repo, sort the groups by author displayName (there is a possible case where an author contributed to multiple repos, and is the lexicographically largest display name among contributors of both repos.

I would propose to resolve this ambiguity in a PR, where each grouping option (by author or repo) can only sort by a fixed set of fields (for example, sort by default order might not make sense for group by author, and sort by author displayName might not make sense for group by repo). Then for sort fields that might have the same value (for example, totalCommits might be the same for several authors/repos), maybe define a default way to break ties by unique fields (for example, the default ordering of repos, or lexicogaphical order of author GitId.

**76 :octicon-issue-opened:** (created issue #2390: Support filtering commits by datetime)
</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 07 17:19:18]%%

Refer to #2388 

We currently support filtering commits by date only.

Since we currently group the commits by dates, and each date has multiple commits, we can't do filtering based on datetime as of now. Propose to change the structure of authorDailyContributionsMap to support this. 

To minimize changes to the codebase, I suggest that we add an additional field for datetime to each commit grouped under the same date. When filtering, we only have to extend the existing filtering logic to filter the datetime for the first and last filtered date. 

For example, if "since" is `2020-01-01T00:02` and "until" is `2020-01-15T23:00`, then we only have to filter the dates as usual, then do additional filtering for commits grouped under `2020-01-01` for time >=00:02, and commits grouped under `2020-01-15` for time &lt;=23:00.

@CYX22222003 Thanks for the review! Yes, the re-parsing of the CSV files is expected. I kept this behavior for two main reasons:

1. Even when the configuration files are re-parsed, it doesn't introduce any side effects to later runs because the system skips the repo analysis and cloning steps in `reportGenerator.generateReposReport`. Only some information in the summary.json file gets updated, and these updates aren't affected by configuration changes.
2. I could have added code to skip parsing the configuration files, but it wouldn't make the system much faster. Using the same logic, I'd need to skip other parts too, and I don't think the performance benefit is worth the extra complexity.

Please let me know what you think. Thank you!

In my opinion, I don't think the performance improvement will be very significant for us to implement this explicitly. For the use case of large CSV files, I tried parsing around 1500 lines in the CSV file and I don't feel a significant performance decrease. It was around one second slower.

I also did a brief trial of skipping the re-parsing. It turns out that there are more complexities in the parsing so it cannot be skipped with just an if statement in the current code. It might involve altering some default behaviour so I think the current implementation will suffice considering the scale of this feature.

Feel free to let me know if you have any concerns!

This check is for the case when `reportConfig` is null due to `report-config.yaml` being invalid or empty This is different from the check in the `ReportConfiguration` constructor, which only happens when the YAML file parses correctly but is missing the `title` field.

Previously in `ArgsParser.java`, an invalid or empty `report-config.yaml` would create an empty `reportConfig` object (not null). I changed this behaviour so that `reportConfig` becomes null when the YAML file can't be parsed successfully hence `getTitle()` would not work in this case.

I made this change because I think it's more logical for `reportConfig` to be null when parsing fails.

The` --config` flag is not a must, but I included it in the documentation for clarity. 

By default, the system automatically looks for a `config` folder in the same directory as the JAR file, containing the `report-config.yaml` file. When using the JAR file, users need to create this `config` folder alongside the JAR and place `report-config.yaml` inside it. 

Would it be better for me to omit this and add an instruction for users to explicitly create a `config` folder?

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 03 17:51:44]%%

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
To complement the repository blurb feature, we can have a feature to allow users to pin or star specific files in their commits. These files would appear at the top of the file list in the RepoSense report, making them easier to access. Users can mention the files in the blurb and highlight these files using the pinning/starring feature.

### Is the feature request related to a problem?
In large commits, important files can get buried in long lists, making it time-consuming to locate them repeatedly.

### If possible, describe the solution
After configuration, a "Pin" or "Star" button would appear at the files. Pinning/Starring it would move the file to a pinned section at the top of the list in Code Panel.

Currently, RepoSense has two features with similar names but different purposes: `title.md` provides an overview for the code analysis dashboard, while the `title` field in `report-config.json` (will be replaced by `report-config.yaml`) sets the browser page title. There is a naming overlap between the features.

The systemtest test case `ConfigSystemTest > testSinceBeginningDateRangeWithPortfolio()` has been intermittently failing, both in local environment (tested on MacOS) and in CIs (https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/actions/runs/14247440833/job/39931867229).

### Possible cause
On further investigation, it seems that the `sinceDate` of `summary.json` produced by the test case is not deterministic. This could be due to `earliestSinceDate` in `ReportGenerator.java` not being set properly after stepping through the code.

Could be linked to [#2026](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2026).

**52 :octicon-issue-opened:** (created issue #2391: Inaccurate docs for blurbs)
</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 09 16:55:13]%%

### Problem
Under the Customizing Reports section of the User Guide, it seems that the documentation for blurbs seems to be outdated. Additionally, there's also a slight bug for the Sample section at `configFiles.md`.

<img width="892" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfc2813-bae5-4322-8522-1fdc4f01773b" />

### Solution
Update `customizingReports.md#personalizing-reports` so that the documentation accurately captures the behaviour for `repo-blurbs.md` and `author-blurbs.md`.

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
With the the one-stop config feature completed (PR: #2299) , we can enhance the feature by supporting different time periods for different repos for more customisability.

Optimally, the `since-date` and `until-date` fields should be optional.

We have already implemented this feature (refer to #2280) for the CSV dates.

### Additional context

Will need to take note of resolving conflict for the dates between different configurations (CLI, CSV and report-config.yaml) 

Please refer to #2334 for more context.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 20 03:14:51]%%

### Description
When the optional title.md file is not included in a repository, the JavaScript console displays a 404 error. Since this file is optional, the system should gracefully handle its absence without generating console errors.

### Current Behavior
- The frontend attempts to load title.md regardless of whether it exists
- A 404 "Not Found" error appears in the browser console when the file is missing

On further investigation, it seems that the `sinceDate` of `summary.json` produced by the test case is not deterministic. This could be due to `earliestSinceDate` in `ReportGenerator.java` not being set properly after stepping through the code.

I don't think it's intended. I noticed the `&lt;hr>` element is absent in both blurbs and title. 
This is most likely due to `normalize.css` resetting the `&lt;hr>` element's styles. I would suggest override these styles in the global `styles.css`

It seems to me that this is a date parsing issue due to different environments. The tests are working on my Mac, Java 11 so I cannot really replicate the bug but I have created a draft PR to enforce strict date time formatting for parsing.

@jonasongg Can you help running the tests on your environment using this branch (https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/2410) and let me know if it resolves the issue?

Since it works on CI and some of the environments, after some investigation, I suspect it's due to existing build files behaviour affecting the tests. I would advise to re-clone the repository. Please let me know if there are any further issues.

I think testing for a `null` search key is similar to testing missing search key because the http request will also return `null` [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/apidocs/jakarta.servlet/jakarta/servlet/servletrequest#getParameter(java.lang.String)](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/apidocs/jakarta.servlet/jakarta/servlet/servletrequest#getParameter(java.lang.String)). Even if it's added, it should be part of the unit tests for the `Action` class.

For testing empty string search key, it actually behaves the same as a normal search query. Its behavior depends entirely on how we mock the search logic using `when(mockLogic.searchStudentsInWholeSystem(searchKey)).thenReturn(...)` or `when(mockLogic.searchStudents(searchKey, instructors)).thenReturn(...)`. So testing it does not provide any additional value.

> Seems like a good improvement to allow `MockEmailSender` to fail when required. Would it be better to throw an exception instead?

It would be better not to throw an exception in this case because the current usage pattern expects a return value indicating the status of the email sending operation. Specifically, the code looks like this:

'''java
EmailSendingStatus status = emailSender.sendEmail(email);
'''

After that, the status is checked with:

'''java
status.isSuccess();
'''

For the first one, I don’t think it’s possible to disable the closed email reminder. Only the closing soon email reminder can be disabled.

For the 2nd one, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think setting these options doesn’t really matter because whether a session needs to send an email depends solely on `getFeedbackSessionsClosedWithinThePastHour();`, which I have mocked.

I didn’t thoroughly check the non-migrated test because it's contaminated with integration tests. Usually, I just focus on the class itself for unit testing, and ensure that each line, branch and edge case is covered.

1. Adding a Test for Missing Parameters
    The `execute()` method in `GetAccountAction` requires non-null Instructor ID parameter. Would it be helpful to add a test case to ensure the method handles missing parameters correctly? For example:
    ```
    @Test
    void testExecute_noParameters_throwsInvalidHttpParameterException() ``{``
        verifyHttpParameterFailure();
    ``}``
    ```

2. Access Control Test Cases
    Since `GetAccountAction` extends `AdminOnlyAction`, do you think it would be beneficial to include tests that verify access control? This can ensure only admins have access to the action. Some possible test cases could be:
    ```
    @Test
    void testSpecificAccessControl_admin_canAccess() ``{`` ... ``}``

    @Test
    void testSpecificAccessControl_instructor_cannotAccess() ``{`` ... ``}``

    @Test
    void testSpecificAccessControl_student_cannotAccess() ``{`` ... ``}``

    @Test
    void testSpecificAccessControl_loggedOut_cannotAccess() ``{`` ... ``}``
    ```

Since you didn't set an `Account` to the instructor, the `googleId` is actually `null`. It's better to have private instance variables for storing Google IDs (students and instructors) which you can then use for logging in or stubbing in `when(mockLogic...)` calls. This applies to other test methods as well.

**Review Status:** DISMISSED

Appreciate your effort! This is a complex class to test.

Just keep in mind that all the Google IDs are `null` by default since `Student` and `Instructor` does not have an `Account` unless we set using `setAccount`. So better to store the IDs in variables so they can be reused for stubbing or logging in.

Also, consider standardizing the test/variable names (for instructor-related) to something like `withCoursePermission`, `withSectionPermission`, `withoutCoursePermission`, and `withoutSectionPermission`, rather than using "same" or "different" so it's clearer which conditional branch is being tested. For teams, we can still use "same" or "different."

After navigating to the Student Home page, the correct number of feedback sessions is initially displayed. However, after a few seconds, the list gets duplicated, leading to redundant entries.

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Navigate to the Student Home page.
2. Observe the initial list of feedback sessions (correct number of sessions displayed).
3. Wait a few seconds without refreshing the page.
4. Notice that the feedback sessions are duplicated.


**Expected behaviour**
- The Student Home page should display each feedback session only once.


**Actual behaviour**
- Initially, the correct number of feedback sessions is displayed.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ec2a3c-70f4-4461-8aec-00f6147d2255)


**Possible causes**:

- A frontend re-render issue causing duplicate entries to appear.
- Improper state management leading to multiple insertions.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Feb 12 15:38:30]%%

## Description:

There are inconsistencies in the naming conventions for various `FeedbackSession` actions, which can cause confusion for contributors and maintainers. Terms like opening soon, opening, open, closing, and closed are used interchangeably without a clear pattern.

## Current Inconsistencies:

1. **Action Classes**:
    - `FeedbackSessionClosedRemindersAction`
    - `FeedbackSessionClosingRemindersAction`
    - `FeedbackSessionOpeningRemindersAction`
    - `FeedbackSessionOpeningSoonRemindersAction`

The terms "Closed" and "Closing" are clear and consistent, but for open sessions, the usage of "Opening" and "OpeningSoon" diverges from this pattern.

2. **Email Enabled Methods**:
    - `setClosingEmailEnabled()` – associated with emails that are sent 24 hours before the session closes.
    - `setOpeningEmailEnabled()` – associated with emails that are sent when the session opens.

## Suggestion:

Adopt a standardized naming convention using OpeningSoon, Opened, ClosingSoon, and Closed across all class names and methods.

1. **Class Name Adjustments**:
    - `FeedbackSessionOpeningRemindersAction` → `FeedbackSessionOpenedRemindersAction`
    - `FeedbackSessionClosingRemindersAction` → `FeedbackSessionClosingSoonRemindersAction`

2. **Method Adjustments**:
    - `setOpenEmailSent()` → `setOpenedEmailSent()`
    - `getFeedbackSessionsWhichNeedOpenEmailsToBeSent()` → `getFeedbackSessionsWhichNeedOpenedEmailsToBeSent()`

3. **Variable Name Adjustments**:
    - `isOpenEmailSent` → `isOpenedEmailSent`
    - `isOpeningEmailEnabled` → `isOpenedEmailEnabled`
    - `isClosingEmailEnabled` → `isClosingSoonEmailEnabled`

4. **CronJob URI Adjustments**:
    - Update CronJobURIs to reflect the class name changes for uniformity.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 10 13:40:26]%%

Currently, the method `sendEmail(email)` in `MockEmailSender` class will always succeed when being called, making it impossible to test failure scenarios.

'''java
public class MockEmailSender extends EmailSender ``{``

    private List&lt;EmailWrapper> sentEmails = new ArrayList&lt;>();

    @Override
    public EmailSendingStatus sendEmail(EmailWrapper email) ``{``
        sentEmails.add(email);
        return new EmailSendingStatus(HttpStatus.SC_OK, null);
    ``}``

    // ...
``}``
'''

Since failure behavior is external and `MockEmailSender` should extend the method descriptors of the actual class, I propose adding a `shouldFail` class field. This would allow us to manually set the method to fail during testing.

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 11 03:45:14]%%

A `NullPointerException` occurs in the `Student` class when calling `getTeamName()`, `getSection()`, or `getSectionName()` on a student instance that has no team.

The `Student` class has two constructors:

- One that accepts a `team` parameter

- One that does not include a `team` parameter

When a student is created using the constructor without a team, the `team` field remains `null`.
However, the methods `getTeamName()`, `getSection()`, or `getSectionName()` do not perform null checks before accessing team properties, leading to a `NullPointerException`.

**Proposed Solution**

Add null checks to the affected methods to prevent exceptions.

Example fix for `getTeamName()`:

'''java
@Override
public String getTeamName() ``{``
    return getTeam() != null ? getTeam().getName() : null;
``}``
'''

A similar approach should be applied to `getSection()` and `getSectionName()`.

I also found out that if a session with previously disabled closing soon email (email was never sent before) is enabled within the 2-day limit after the session has already closed and closed email has been sent, the closing soon email will still be sent because the query only checks for `isClosingSoonEmailSent` and `isClosingSoonEmailEnabled`.

Currently, `doRemoveAndRestoreDataBundle` does not fully clean up entities created dynamically during a test, such as when `FeedbackQuestion` is copied.

This happens because `removeSqlDataBundle` only deletes entities that are listed in the given `SqlDataBundle`. Entities created during the test are not included in the original `SqlDataBundle` and therefore persist in the database after the test finishes.

When I repeatedly run the test and execute some scripts in the browser console, I observe that more and more question forms accumulate in that same feedback session.

I have a issue with this part of the code from 'line 149-155'.

After those lines gets run one time, the next time when I rerun the test again, I will face this error:
'teammates.common.exception.HttpRequestFailedException: Request failed: [409] ``{``"message":"Some entities in the databundle already exist","requestId":"586c09236d8bd7333f5f37de7b98217c"``}``

Re-trying removeAndRestoreDataBundle'

Without the lines '149-155', I can pass all the test cases without issue multiple times. Would appreciate any insight from anybody, thanks!

@InfinityTwo, so do you think its better to leave it out or just let it stay since it doesnt fail CI on gitub

> @InfinityTwo's observation observation is correct, because the cleanup of data after the SQL E2E tests are not very well done, and hence the data persists, so locally the behaviour may duffer due to old data. I think it's probably a larger overarching problem with the SQL E2E tests, hence I'm fine with leaving it as is, as it passes the current CI (where the testbed is expected to be clean)

Hi @jasonqiu212, I tried this, but it doesn’t seem to work.

Fetching archived courses only interacts with the datastore logic, which automatically sets `isCourseMigrated` to `true` by default. Because of this, in lines 123-125 of `GetCoursesAction.java`, the filter method that checks `isCourseMigrated` causes the returned course list to always be empty.

As a result, when attempting to retrieve archived courses using the new SQL logic, we always end up with an empty array list.

I think it looks fine.

Just a note—I typically run tests using IntelliJ’s built-in features rather than executing them manually using the terminal. In the test file, I just click the green test button and a task window pops up. In the task window, I will then select to run `unitTests`, since we’ve only been working with unit tests. The screenshot of the intellij window pop-up is attached below:

Would it be helpful to add comments for developers who primarily use IDE features? Maybe we could include guidance for popular IDEs like VS Code and IntelliJ.

Hi @jasonqiu212, sorry for the late reply! I agree that actively supporting IDE-based development may not be feasible, as it would require maintaining instructions for multiple IDEs and keeping up with their updates.

Could you clarify what you mean by a "simple link"? Are you suggesting linking to general IDE documentation or a specific resource?

**82 :octicon-issue-opened:** (created issue #13326: Poor data cleanup after the SQL E2E tests leads to unexpected errors when running E2E tests)
</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 30 16:14:02]%%

## Steps to reproduce
1. In an E2E test, call `feedbackEditPage.deleteSession()`.  
2. Run the E2E test suite once.  
3. Run the same E2E test suite again using the same json file for the E2E test,

## Expected behaviour
- All entities created during the test should be deleted.  
- Each E2E test run should start with a fresh database state, without any persisted values from previous runs.  

## Actual behaviour
- The second test run fails with: `teammates.common.exception.HttpRequestFailedException: Request failed: [409] ``{``"message":"Some entities in the databundle already exist","requestId":"586c09236d8bd7333f5f37de7b98217c"``}```.

**Additional info**
- The bug is further discussed in this PR: [[#12048] Migrate InstructorFeedbackEditPageE2ETest #13314](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/13324).
- However, it is unfixed at the moment.
&lt;!-- You can enter any additional relevant info here. -->
&lt;!-- If you know what caused the bug and/or how to resolve the bug, you can include them in this section. -->
- The only way to fix this issue is to change the JSON entity names.

@jasonqiu212 Thanks for taking your time to review the PR yesterday with me! I've pushed the requested changes based on our discussion, let me know if I missed anything out.

As for the NoMasquarade part that I couldn't answer yesterday, if I'm not wrong, it's because I wanted to use `verifyAnyInstructorsCanAccess()` originally. However, that method in `BaseActionTest.java` calls the method `verifyAccessibleForAdminsToMasqueradeAsInstructor()`, which fails the test case as from my knowledge, you can't masquerade as an instructor from admin, if admins cannot access it. Then because of that, I had to make a special method for `verifyAnyInstructorsCanAccess()` which checks the opposite case of masquerade check.

I think the idea is great, but from what I saw the last time, the use of ```UsageStatisticsAttributes``` is only for the old datastore logic. I think once migration is completed, I believe the use for it becomes redundant and it solely uses ```UsageStatistics``` in the action, assuming we remember to change it after migration. Right now, it seems like it just concatenates both values together for the output. 

I was thinking we could add a comment to remove it eventually but @jasonqiu212 what do you think? I'm cool with either ways.

> Was thinking if we can explore abstracting the access control tests in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, like in the old tests. Currently, I feel like there's a lot of repeated code for testing access control

Hmm, great idea, I was thinking of it as well instead of copy pasting it for each new migrated test. I think the next time I work on it, I'll add the abstraction and do a refactor of the PRs.

Do you think we should make it similar to the previous method names such as ```verifyOnlyAdminsCanAccess()``` or should we have one method for it all, and pass in 6? boolean parameters for each user type?

I think your idea is great, but however, if we choose to catch `NullPointerException` (at least this is what I understand from your second paragraph), it will fail linting as it avoids catching `NullPointerException`. As for the use of `getUuidFromString`, I'll addon to this PR if we are choosing not to deal with the NPE but if not, I'll add it to #13237, the issue you would like to me create.

Of course, though the reason has been mentioned in the description of the PR from the start, but I'll quote it for you since the both of you missed it

> However, two of the tests (testExecute_addNotification_success() and testExecute_invalidParameter_throwsInvalidHttpParameterException()) that fails are disabled, which is inline with the originally disabled tests since it did not work in the first place.

You're right that it was just because I didn't use ```when()``` and so it return an NPE. I think I wasn't as familiar with the codebase on the second PR and didn't realise it was just that 🤣 

Anyways, thanks for the suggestion. I've used your suggestion in the commit and fixed both disabled test cases :)

I think it's useful to show that we need to run ```npm run test``` for Snapshot Testing. However, I think it would also be great if you could add a hyperlink in ```snapshot-testing.md``` in the "How do we use Snapshot Testing?" section to this part, or perhaps you can add instructions there on which commands we could use. It's a little confusing to newer developers because the given Jest docs link shows a different command (```jest --updateSnapshot```). 

On a side note, it would help me greatly as well since I haven't found the right way to do so with my button PR 🤣

Perhaps if we can't give a time estimate, would it be reasonable if we provide them a warning about the large number of test cases and the long execution time needed, or a floor value in number of test cases/time needed?

This is because most developers who work on Teammates might come from smaller projects where testing suite is not as large and they might (because I did) just stare at the terminal until it completes instead of doing something else in the meantime. I don't think it's necessary at the end of the day but it's definitely a nice to know :)

Would it be neater if you can abstract the equality checks (or the entire for loop) to a private method in the test? Same goes for the verify method calls as well, but that one might be a bit of a stretch.

I'm not sure how related it is to this unit test but I was thinking could we perhaps add some test cases to test the search key string matching? I'm not sure about the current logic but for example, searching "joh" could yield the results for "john" or something like that

I like the different tests for null parameters here! It might not be necessary but I was thinking would it be a good idea to test for a null `ErrorReportRequest` object too to further test line 26 in the action file's execute method `ErrorReportRequest report = getAndValidateRequestBody(ErrorReportRequest.class);`?

Hmm yeah you are right, but in a way, I wanted to also create an awareness of it's existence just in case @mingyang143 does the cleanup during his summer internship doing TEAMMATES. It's totally fine if it's not changed either since both ways, I don't think it's consistent with all the migrated tests that they all use Sql at the end.

After looking through a bit of the code, what I'm understanding is that when you delete the session, it changes the database values and it persists across tests. When it reinitialises with a fresh JSON data bundle, it sends a PUT request to the server with that JSON data and compares the JSON data with the server. It only deletes if they match because they use PUT request. However, since it doesn't match, a PUT request will update the data values to the same as the JSON values. This is followed by a POST request to insert the JSON values into the db. By doing that, it is trying to insert already existing values and so it fails.

I didn't look into the postgres code so I cannot say that this is indeed the cause but this is what I kinda understood from the rabbit hole, hopefully it helps!

@mingyang143 I feel that in production, this is not a case to worry about since you won't really ever override data like this, so I think you can leave it and it shouldn't be an issue, though you can consider writing a comment about it in the file.

# Feature Enhancement
Add a show all/collapse all button for students on their submission page.

- **Environment**: &lt;!-- The environment in which the said feature/enhancement is absent, e.g. live server at `V8.0.0`, `master` branch at commit 1234567. --> master

## **Description of feature/enhancement**
A button to show or collapse all responses for students on their form submission page.



## **Justification**
&lt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->
If a student comes back to the submission page, they can choose to collapse all to easily see which questions are unanswered.
Once a student submits all the questions, they can collapse all to quickly check if all tabs are green.



## **Existing similar features and their shortcomings**
&lt;!-- Explain why existing similar features fall short of your expectation. -->
&lt;!-- This section can be skipped if there are no existing similar features. -->
This feature exists in the edit feedback session page for instructors, and I think it could be added for students too.

&lt;br>

PS: I originally planned on taking this feature enhancement which was fully implemented, but never got around to fixing my snapshot error. See my PR #13203 for details.

Hi @JoseG2003-g, my PR for this issue essentially has the feature fully implemented. However, it only does not pass e2e testing (on firefox unstable specifically). Feel free to either help my PR out with that or if you have a better implementation in the works, that's cool with me as well if you want to create your own solution.

On a side note, I may attempt to further debug my PR in the coming days if I have the time so it could get resolved.

**70 :octicon-issue-opened:** (created issue #13304: Refactoring for Unit Test Access Controls)
</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 05 14:00:38]%%

Data migration initiated by PR #12048.
Partially completed in #13254 (once this is merged, feel free to contribute).

## Issue
&lt;!-- Issue title: Data Migration: [summary of affected entities and fields] -->
After most of the Unit Tests migration in #12048, there were a lot of inconsistencies in access controls. This issue aims to improve the inconsistency of the migration as `BaseActionTest.java` had minimal migration in Access Controls.

## Status
As of the merging of #13254, all but `SubmitFeedbackResponsesActionTest.java` Unit Tests have been migrated. Following that, the progress for this refactoring can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IcB-viJMrIOknYoBYasBuRBK9qnwY0-doEK4_Eb24IA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I may periodically update the sheets if anyone successfully merge new PRs.

## Contribution
The refactoring for most tests are quite straightforward. I have reviewed and refactored until `GetFeedbackQuestionRecipientsActionTest.java` in the sheets above (~50% of the tests). The remaining ones are for contributors who are new and would like to start somewhere easy. 

If you would like to contribute, check the sheets and comments for already migrated tests before starting. Do understand the methods in `BaseActionTest.java`, follow the refactoring in #13254, and ensure that all unit tests and linting passes before submitting your PR. Please comment which tests you intend to touch on so other contributors do not conflict with yours.

Here's two suggestions to help out new developers that could help with confusion (which it did for me).
- When downloading `chromedriver`, the link provided for it shows an old version of `chromedriver` before Chrome v115. It takes two further clicks to find the right page for the latest version of Chrome (currently v135 for stable). I think it would be great if we can relink it to either the [Version Selection Page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads/version-selection) or the download links for the latest version [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/), and highlight specifically to download `chromedriver`, and not `chrome` or `chrome-headless-shell` since I think most devs will not be running such an old version of chrome anyways.
- We could specify what does E2ETryTest1 to 5 means, and that there's also an Sql version too.

Edit: Here's an unrelated suggestion but I think it's not worth a separate PR for: In the Getting Started/Setting Up and all other pages which uses the same line, the line "Replace ./gradlew to gradlew.bat if you are using Windows." could have the word "to" changed to "with".

Should the test still be migrated then?

May I clarify if we need to migrate that line of the old test? I am thinking we do not need to because I call `when(mockLogic.getAccountRequest(id)).thenReturn(accountRequest)` in the new test case. If I call `assertNull()` here to check for a successfully deleted `accountRequest`, it will always fail because of the mocked response.

Same here, may I clarify if we need to migrate that line of the old test? For this case, I feel it may be redundant since I mock the response `when(mockLogic.getAccountRequest(id)).thenReturn(accountRequest)` to always return `accountRequest`. So even if the deletion fails or succeeds, `assertNotNull()` will always be true.

While this works, would it be better to take advantage of the auto scaling capabilities of css? 
We can avoid these breakpoints and corresponding values since the parent colspan of 7 scales according to screen size already, such that the children widths are always relative to the parent without changing their individual colspan or the parents. 
In order to preserve the full child item being shown when the screen shrinks, consider instead using min-width/max-width css properties with media queries to shift responsiveness logic to css where possible.

Would it be better to use a calculation relative to the app-filter-bar? By applying a position: relative to the app filter bar you can position the child element of class filters relative to that parent when the child has position: absolute. Therefore you could then do something like top: 100%; instead on this element and it will be positioned nicely under the filter bar.

I see the vision and am open to the possibility of using a scrollable filters container like you have implemented. 
However, I feel that the scrollbar is not very intuitive to the user, i.e., not what you would find on most other sites. It will also be quite hard to use on a small screen like a mobile screen compared to a hamburger or dropdown menu, which is the very audience this change is supposed to cater to.
I would prefer a different approach but you are free to continue working on this approach and try to apply some cosideration for mobile users who don't have that much space to scroll horizontally for example left and right scroll buttons at the ends of the scrollbar.

Great implementation of a hamburger dropdown and I like the substitution of mat grid you made.
However, there is some redundancy and minor errors in regards to CSS to fix.
Additionally, would it be better to put the app-label-filters into the hamburger dropdown as well since on small screens at first glance it now seems to suggest it denotes something about all filters.

Should groups be forced into the hidden list? 
The functionality of the hidden list is to display information about which groups happen to be hidden because of the filters selected. 
The use of this function to specify unique behaviour for groups that shouldn't be shown in the hidden list even when they are empty, such as the NO_ASSIGNEE group.
Forcing groups into the hidden list goes against this single responsibility and erodes into the responsibility of the filters.

Should the filtersService contain a method to return a list of filtered assignees?
The filters service has the single responsibility of housing filters used throughout the application. Therefore the most updated filters should already be within the filter$ observable, handled by the component updating the filter. This method goes against this responsibility and its implementation even outside the filters service shouldn't happen since it implies an error in the use of the filters service.

I understand your following of the already implemented methods ``getAssigneesForCurrentlyActive`` and ``getMilestonesForCurrentlyActive``. Those methods are exclusively used to populate the filters based on the preset view which is currently handled by the filters service. 
As an aside, it might make more sense to move the preset view and the corresponding functions out of filters service in the future.

A good effort at eradicating the bug that works effectively. 
However, a number of responsibilities of the services are eroded by the implementation.
I would suggest a much simpler and structured fix by looking at ``~/src/app/shared/issue-tables/dropdownfilter.ts``. It already has reference to both services and has a consolidated section where filters are applied.
Please follow up with any questions or concerns you might have.

Before I merge the PR, could you craft the commit message according to the conventions outlined [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html)
I understand it is a small PR that doesn't necessarily require such a comprehensive format but it would be good to standardize the convention even for small PRs. 
You can refer to the commit messages of other closed PRs for inspiration.

Should you be changing the behaviour of all mat tooltips? Other tooltips throughout the application have unintentionally been forced to follow the new defaults. Perhaps it would be better if absolutely necessary to set the custom options on the respective custom tooltips as required. On another note, is there a reason for these specific overrides of the defaults?

Should you be changing the style of all mat tooltips? Other tooltips throughout the application have unintentionally been forced to follow this font size. ng-deep is dangerous in this way. Perhaps a better solution would be to use the ``matTooltipClass`` property on the component where ``[matToolTip]`` is applied and define a custom class for the unique style.

Is there a reason for using em instead of rem here? In this case since tooltips are direct descendents of the root when created by mattooltips they are the same. However, I believe it would be clearer and make more sense to be rem instead of em, especially if a developer expects the em behaviour.

Use of tooltips means no new packages required and is effective in keeping users informed of label definitions. However, there are unintentional consequences to a number of global defaults. Overall a good start to enhancing CATcher. Effort displayed particularly in utilizing existing code. Great Job!

Great PR that fixes the comment inaccuracy of the template. Just some github related comments.
In this case the linked issue contains multiple parts that cannot be fixed in this one PR. Therefore, in order for github to not automatically close the linked issue on merge, could you change the ``Fixes [issue_number]`` to something like ``Addresses part of [issue_number]`` in the PR description.  
Additionally, it would be good to update the proposed commit message to something more descriptive for standardization regardless of PR size. You may refer to the git convention linked to by our CATcher documentation. I will put a direct link [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html).

More information for the git commit message guidelines can be found [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html).

@HollaG I agree with this comment about the commit message and to add on I believe it would also be appropriate to include the reasoning for the change in a similar format as the resource linked.
Additionally, while I think the change is sufficient, we should wait for an update from @damithc on #1324 for additional differentiation before merging.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When the screen width is reduced, the filter bars are cut off and not a responsive design

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A togglable hamburger when the width reaches a certain minimum that houses filters

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Making the filters on top of one another is also possible but might create a really long page

**Additional context**

2. Delete ``package-lock.json`` and ``node/`` folder
3. Use node version 16.20.2
4. Run npm install in root folder
5. See error

**Expected behavior**
No error during install

This error only starts occuring today despite no changes in dependencies, implying a packages nested dependency on the cookie package has changed.
I would appreciate some confirmation on the error I am getting from other devices and suggestions on fixing.
One valid solution is to upgrade our node version to 18.

%%[created at: 2025 Jan 23 19:49:03]%%

Upon further research into the dependency tree, I have found the updated dependency is ``engine.io@6.6.3``, a deeply nested dependency of ``karma`` that just released a new version as of the afternoon of 23/1/25. This in turn depends on ``cookie@1.0.2``, causing our node dependency errors.
Instead of upgrading the node version which might lead to many unforseen incompatibility in production with our packages, a safer fix for now would be to explicitly require ``engine.io@6.6.2``.
In the long term, we should upgrade the angular version, node version and corresponding packages carefully to satisfy the dependency.

I like this idea but what should be hidden and what shouldn't be might be up for discussion.
In my opinion, just the items per page and future filters (pending discussion) can be within the dropdown and the rest is important enough to be considered common.

I prefer your first suggestion because I dislike the behaviour of the drop-down when it overflows the screen height. 
I.e, the dropdown will cover up the other filters and be disjoint from the dropdown root, making it harder to create custom filter combinations.

With the second option I think it would be good if the dropdown opened to the right of the dropdown root, thus resolving my concerns and making the filters more extensible.

Would welcome different opinions

Would not recommend try-catching as part of the control flow, i.e. `this.isChangingRepo.next(false)` should not be in the `catch` block. Perhaps you can do this in `verifyOwnerAndRepo` before throwing the error in the same method, and remove the try-catch block here?

Also @Eclipse-Dominator I don't really like the idea of separating the logic for the search on title into a separate file. Possibly just declare the function `getTitleColumnContent` in the same `search-filter.ts` file?

First part of 3-state labels has been done. Second part to this is to create an "eye icon" besides each label, so that the user can click on the eye icon to hide the label from the table. It should do the same thing as pressing the eye icon from the label dropdown.

Not sure if milestones and labels are a strong-enough reason for making preset filters repo-specific, but making the preset filters repo-specific only makes it more confusing. There are cases where users want to make preset filters that can applied across repos. Furthermore, user can switch to another preset filters if he needs to change the preset filter.

The bug is because the request to update the labels was sent before the reqeust to create a comment was sent. I am looking into changing the order that the requests are sent.

The error message only pops up for at most 5 seconds. Lmk if it persists for more than 5 seconds.

I could only reproduce when I time to press the submit button correctly. Currently the page polls from Github to update the issue details every 5 seconds. Usually, creating a new team response includes an `updateIssue` request followed by a `createComment` request. So to produce the bug, I have to time to press the submit button so that the order of requests is:  `updateIssue -&gt; poll -&gt; createComment`. It happens only in rare cases. Also, the error goes away when the next `poll` request finishes.

@damithc Looks like this bug has been here for quite some time, even before this semester. The code was written in the way that purposefully prevents creating a repository for admin and tutors, which is why the error message arises as expected. Can I just check what should admins and tutors be able to view for phase bug reporting? Are they supposed to only see a blank screen?

Yea that works, but that would create a new repository for the admins, but admins do not need the repo for anything. I'm not too sure what admins should be able to do when they login to CATcher during bug reporting phase. Should we just allow admins to create repository in their own Github account?

I think we can consider merging `convert` and `generateTemplateDefault` into a single function that handles the `markbind init` case here, given that many of the functions being called are common (All of the functions being called in `generateTemplateDefault` are called in `convert`). The parameters being passed into the two functions are the same as well. What do you think?

This should isolate the `init` case better, and would contribute to cleaning up / refactoring `Site/index.ts` - especially given that `generateTemplateDefault` is newly introduced in this PR.

Since this method now handles the default file generation for `markbind init` and conversion for `markbind init --convert`, a name like `initSite` might be more suitable (and self-explanatory), as compared to `generateTemplateDefault` - what do you think?

Ah I should have been clearer, I was also pointing to:

```
+ 'Check https://markbind.org/userGuide/tweakingThePageStructure.html#site-navigation-menus\n'
+ 'for information on site navigation menus.');
```

But looking at the current setup of your functions, it may be more hassle than worth, so the current changes should be fine 👍 

We can re-visit this should we decide that a link to the UG for Site Navigation during conversion is helpful.

Hi, thanks for the PR @jingting1412! I've taken a look at the template, and I just have a few broad comments / suggestions that has to do with the UI / UX rather than the implementation itself:

- For a student portfolio, I would imagine that a sleek look would be preferred instead of too much clutter (though we could assume that this would be their first ever portfolio that they are setting up). 
  - I think we can reduce the clutter in the top navbar to only contain the GitHub and the LinkedIn logo - the search function is unlikely to be used, and the topics on the sidebar should be sufficient for navigation, since we aren't expecting a particularly lengthy site.
  - Breadcrumbs may not be needed for the same reason - the site is unlikely to be too lengthy. 
- I think we can include "Skills" and "Experience" as topics on the main page rather than as a separate page?
  - "Skills" can be the set of tech that the student has used previously, so I'm thinking of maybe having three [Panels](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/presentation.html#panels) titled "Languages", "Frameworks & Tools", and "Others" respectively. And within those panels, maybe we can include examples for these. The two portfolio links that @yucheng11122017 posted has some possible examples.
  - It would be nice to present "Experience" as a simple timeline similar to how LinkedIn presents it, so [Boxes](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/presentation.html#boxes) might be suitable here? It might be also useful to make use of the vertical line created by a [Blockquote](https://markbind.org/userGuide/formattingContents.html#blockquotes) here.
- The main container on the main page can be used to display: Name, short description, and profile image. Basically, embed the "Hello there! ..." section's current content into the black container instead of repeating the same-ish content twice.
- We could add some styling for the individual projects pages as well, similar to the layouts used by the two aforementioned portfolio links!
- The "Navigating this site" section will need to be updated - and maybe we can also include some information indicating that this portfolio is a simplified version (if we do decide to remove some navbar features, etc), and if the student wants access to more features, they can use other templates instead.

These are suggestions rather than directions, and feel free to counter these if you feel that they are not preferable :+1:

> One issue I'm facing is whether to add a section that introduces new users to the site, and to MarkBind features overall. I have added a small tip on the homepage that links users to the user guide, but I'm wondering if I should add a small section on introducing the site and give some tips about what features they might find useful (similar to the "Navigating this page" section on the current default template) to help first-time users editing the page.

I think introducing markbind features shouldn't be a role for the portfolio page, so your current approach should be sufficient - having said that, if you feel that there are specific markbind features that might specifically be useful for the portfolio page, you can add more of them in as tips 👍

Instead of making this change (since we rely on the conversions from slots to templates, and do not use header templates directly in our `.vue` files), a suggestion I have is to just directly treat the `header` as a prop instead, without relying on slot conversion?

In `Dropdown.vue`, we can first include the `header` as a prop:

```
props: ``{``
  ...
  header: ``{``
    type: String,
    default: '',
  ``}``,
  ...
```

And then we can replace the `<slot name="header"></slot>` under the `v-if`, with ```{`` header ``}```. We could also rename `header` to something like `tabgroup-header` to differentiate it as well.

This might be a less hacky solution, but if we can investigate the issue deeper and find a better solution, that would be best 👍

> I don't quite understand how the Vue component's prop is being passed as a named slot. Referring to the [developer guide](https://markbind.org/devdocs/devGuide/development/writingComponents.html), I tried to trace the processing but I think I might be facing a skill issue. I'm confused as it says that "MarkBind attributes are passed to the Vue component as props. The type of the prop will be a String." However, the prop is able to be processed as a named slot.

The [`createSlotTemplateNode`](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/src/html/elements.ts#L11-L13) method is used to convert slots into template nodes directly; this is called by the [`processAttributeWithoutOverride`](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/src/html/MdAttributeRenderer.ts#L30-L50) method, which is in turned called for specified named slots that we are looking out for. This is how we process named slots - hopefully this addresses your question (and if it doesn't, do let me know).

Regardless, this issue might need further investigation 😓

As discussed previously, this is a fantastic addition to MarkBind!

Something to consider after this PR would be the usability aspect. Given that the existing search function (by header) differs from this one (by text), with neither being replacements for the other (and with valid use cases for both), what we should consider is:

How do we increase the visibility of this plugin? Is documentation sufficient for users to be able to find and use this plugin, or should we actively include it in our templates? (And if so, how do we arrange / prioritise the two search functions in the UI?)

As mentioned during the group discussion, [SICP JS](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/sicpjs/3.2.1) in Source Academy handles this problem by putting both search functions side-by-side. By this train of thought, it might be worthwhile to make both of the search functions into modular components.

> To add, the ideal outcome is that this plugin replaces both the current search (i.e., headers only) feature and the need to use third party search.

During the discussion with @gerteck, the point made was that searching by header and searching by text have somewhat different use cases and each of them might be necessary for different situations (especially since MarkBind tends to be header-heavy given its use case). If the initial goal was to replace the current search with this plugin, then I think we should consider one of these:

1. Either make this new plugin into a component & make it the default search on current templates (for easier use & to establish it as the "default"), or:
2. Find a way to integrate the two components into one (maybe there can be an overarching search component with a toggle between header-search and text-search via a prop?)

Of course, keeping in mind that this is out of scope for this PR & we may have to open a new issue to continue discussing this (@gerteck feel free to start this discussion issue), also given this comment:

> there will be a need for further analysis of the cost and benefit of making certain plugins default and increasing the usability/visibility of the features of each plugin.

The conditional logic is slightly convoluted for me here. If `start !== UNBOUNDED` is true, and `isHighlightSpaces` is true, and `start > line.length` is false, what happens? (Will this even happen in theory?)

Also, given that Lines 129-130 and 132-133 are duplicated, I wonder if there is a way to simplify this chunk of code. We don't need to shy away from ternary conditional operators if they make the code easier to understand.

@damithc in terms of the tab conversion to 4 instead of 8, would this comment still hold?

> Don't worry about backward compatibility. It is unlikely to affect any existing MarkBind sites, as this is a very much an edge case of usage.

Given that this is a visual change, and the only functionality (that I can think of at the moment) that might be affected by tab size is the highlight feature being merged in with this PR, I think it should be fine to make this change? I don't think the 8 spaces was an intentional implementation (given that 2 or 4 is the usual standard).

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

Thanks for the PR, @AgentHagu!

Revisiting a discussion point that we brought up earlier - in the cases of other kinds of whitespaces being present (e.g. tab or newline), how do we handle it? E.g. I can see a situation where the user copy-pastes in an existing chunk of code with whitespace, and non-space whitespace characters are added in directly. This may just be a documentation problem though given that this is not highly likely & usually these are converted to whitespaces in many IDEs etc, what do you think? Or is there a tweak we can do that will efficiently cover these cases?

Hmm... I believe we didn't specify the `npm` and `node` versions to minimize documentation update overhead when updating versions, so on second thought, this might not be necessary.

@IanCheah The deployment itself looks rather different from this one [here](https://portfolio-template-markbind.netlify.app/) mentioned in the PR #2398 for the template; there are of course bound to be some changes, but the icons etc. seem to be displayed incorrectly?

Personally, the PR is LGTM - with just one nit. Instead of using the icon for the sample sites, it might be better to just use text-based buttons to be consistent with the rest of the user guide.

Are there places where we are using icon buttons for similar purpose @IanCheah?

Just to add on a small comment, the first error message originates from [here](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/runtime-core/__tests__/helpers/resolveAssets.spec.ts#L99). Certainly not trivial to debug, and we'll need to look into if it is worth spending more time on the issue this semester.

As discussed, we'll have a couple of the active devs (CS3281) working on this issue - mainly by researching the topic and understanding what is causing the issue. We will set an internal deadline of 9 March. If by then we have not made significant progress with this, we will have to prioritize other issues / features.

> Besides just IP addresses, should we also allow for hostnames like "localhost"?
> 
> In general, what should we count as a valid host for MarkBind?

Yes, we should allow for `localhost`. Beyond that, custom hostnames would be difficult to account for without allowing a wide range of allowed hostnames that are potentially invalid as well. But given that it would have worked fine until now, we should certainly look into how we can accommodate for this.

> Allow for IPV6 addresses to be specified (though I dont see much reason a user might want to use it, except maybe for the shorthand for localhost ::1)

We certainly should, by the same logic: if it is possible now for a user to use it (and it is valid), then it should still be possible. Anyway, ipv6 addresses are definitely valid use cases.

> Allow users to specify port number along with the IP address (the current implementation automatically redirects to a different port number if the default port is being used), though again, I don't quite see why users might want to specify separate ports

The [`-p` flag](https://markbind.org/userGuide/cliCommands.html#serve-command) is meant for specifying port numbers, so this wouldn't be necessary.

Seems to change cursor when hovering above the green portion even though nothing happens when you click it. Is this intentional?

Additionally, `hover focus` seems to also activate this cursor change even though it only shows a popover and is not a clickable. Any thoughts @Incogdino?

Having the pointer change on hover for clickable items is certainly good; but for popovers (i.e. activated on hover and not by clicking; clicking does nothing), I'm wondering if the cursor change is necessary. Pointer changes should indicate that something can be activated via clicking

I think being clickable implies that there is action that you can do on click; for this case, when you hover, a popover appears; you can click it once to make it disappear, but after that, subsequent clicks will not trigger any action. So from that perspective, I think it might be worth a look to see if it is worth removing the cursor change on hover for these cases.

Regardless, it seems that this is not behavior introduced in this PR - maybe this can be discussed in a separate issue / PR. For this PR itself, I have no further issues.

As discussed with @damithc, we're pushing for this to be merged in within the next 2 days, after which we will release MarkBind v6.0.0. @MarkBind/active-devs let's proceed with the final round of checks and testing, and @gerteck do let us know your plans for this PR if there are any remaining.

In terms of the tags, the current implementation seems to be an OR implementation; I am thinking if AND is more intuitive. Perhaps we could also provide a way to choose between the two behaviors? And as a nit, in terms of the design, adding some space between the "Tags:" and the actual tags would be nice.

That aside, as @AgentHagu pointed out, the behavior of the search bar is rather unintuitive. Filtering based on the last keyword seems to be the current behavior, which is rather unexpected. 

E.g. this would not be the expected result for users, I would imagine:

LGTM, the feature works well; I couldn't find any regressions. Features like selecting between AND / OR, as well as using this for icons, can be followed-up in later PRs. Thanks @Incogdino!

There seems to be quite a few conditional checks in this function... I think that a refactor of these into separate functions might be good for readability and to simplify the logic. There seems to be this:

```
results.push(``{``
  highlightType: HIGHLIGHT_TYPES.<Somthing>,
  bounds: null,
  color: this.color,
``}``);
```

That seems to be repeated quite a bit - which I think would also benefit from a refactoring round.

Same as above. One too many nested conditionals for my comfort... We can take a look at a separate refactor PR after the v6 release. Seems like we should at least do a refactor round before the highlight logic becomes a bit too convoluted.

> I think there was a typo. What I meant was something like `1[:]#00ff00` or `1[:]#y`. I think in general putting both hex color codes and color names after the same # will not lead to confusion? Correct me if I am wrong.

On the contrary, given that the convention is to have `#` for color hex codes and not for names (e.g. "red" or "blue"), having `#` would not be consistent with standard color notation conventions. Moreover, I don't think I would like the additional logic we would have to implement (e.g. check if string is 6 or 3 letters containing hexadecimal to decide if it is hex or not) - seems unnecessary. I think using `@` is perfectly fine. 

I agree that the usage of the color highlighting makes the string quite complex though. The example given: 

```
java ``{``.line-numbers highlight-lines="1[:]@pink,3['Inventory']@blue,3[4::6]@orange,4['It\'s designed']@#000000,5@rgb(120, 130, 250),6[8:15]@purple,6[18:]@yellow,8[0::2],12[:]-14,16-18,20[12:]-22,24[1::]-26"``}``
```

This is quite unreadable to me at this point, and if the person wants more organized color highlighting for their code (e.g. highlight whenever certain keywords appear), this will be quite annoying to modify one by one. I think it's certainly going to be worth discussing how to improve this feature. 

But as a first stage implementation, I think this is a good first step.

Thanks for the PR @IanCheah! A few comments mostly on a potential refactor PR after this one (and likely after v6). 

Another idea is expanding the colored highlight idea for specific keywords; it might be nice if the user can e.g. pass in a key-value mapping for keywords to colors, and we apply that mapping over a given code block. Maybe we can even expand this to beyond code blocks, to the page (or pages) in general. I think this can be further discussed in a separate issue!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the codecov CI failing on master branch being a false positive is not documented in the dev guide, right? We can update the dev documentation to reflect this if that is the case

> My impression is that we will use it during PR review to evaluate if our coverage is degraded severely by the PR, and we may or may not opt to do anything about it (depending on the context)

As an aside - I still think that we should add this into the dev guide, for documentation purposes at least. Personally, seeing the X for CI failure on master branch is still rather unnerving, even if it's a false positive 😓 and additionally, if it's a false positive, we shouldn't have it show up on master branch in the first place since it can be misleading (though we should 100% still indicate coverage degradation on the PR itself for consideration during the review process, which loops back to what we want to further investigate for codecov as suggested by @tlylt)

@AgentHagu would you like to add this to the dev guide? Might be suitable for the project management section

Thanks for the changes @Incogdino, I like the new changes for the copy button! The tooltips are quite useful.

As an addition, for the wrap button, I wonder if we can indicate the wrap state with css (perhaps light -&gt; dark color scheme for the button when in wrap text mode)? At the moment, when clicking on the wrap text button, there is no visual response on click. We can even have text changes in the tooltip according to whether it is in "wrap mode" or not, though that might be optional if the visual changes are handled well.

### What is the area that this feature belongs to?

_No response_

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

With the addition of new templates in #2384, #2385, and #2386, we should look into ways to dynamically update specific sections of MarkBind Templates as MarkBind constantly updates (as mentioned [here](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2386#issuecomment-1900636012)). This will require us to identify which sections of templates are more prone to changes (e.g. MarkBind components) and which sections are not (e.g. Template-specific content). 

### Describe the solution you'd like

There are existing .njk files for site generation (mainly used for `init --convert`), e.g. `packages/core/src/Site/siteConvertLayout.njk`. We can consider extending this idea to newer templates to allow for dynamic site generation, meaning that we will have fewer files to be edited. However, this will likely be limited mainly to the `default.md` and other `.md` files for the templates.

Regardless of whether the above is feasible or not, long-term maintainability will need to be considered in the future as we continue to add more templates.

Currently, there are several `npm` vulnerabilities being reported for MarkBind.

While some warnings are not directly relevant to MarkBind and can be of a lower priority, it is still better to resolve some of these before it potentially snowballs.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The `npm` package manager advises running `npm audit fix` to automatically fix some of the vulnerabilities, but I am uncertain that this will allow us to resolve the issues properly (e.g. if the solutions suggested go against what we are planning, or if the solutions suggested is to directly upgrade packages we are maintaining for other reasons).

Ideally, we should go through the list and resolve the vulnerabilities individually (or even assess whether these are relevant or not). Any suggestions on better approaches welcome!

Context: [CS3282 Lightning Talk on PWA](https://github.com/nus-cs3281/2025/issues/22)

PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) are a way to achieve native app -like features for a website / web application. Caching resources through service workers allow for websites to be loaded and used offline.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Given that the use case of MarkBind targets textbooks / guides that are wordy and usually static, it might be useful to support PWA-ification of MarkBind sites. (E.g. CS2103T textbook website can be converted to a PWA that appears as if it is a native mobile app, and can be used without internet connection)

Support for PWA-ification is widely available; e.g. [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/progressive-web-apps) is the guide for Next.js apps.

If we can do something similar (either automate the process via CLI commands, or at least provide a guide to PWA-ifying a MarkBind site), this can prove quite useful. Offline functionality for static sites seem very promising IMO.

The IDE can help add components (e.g. add in the table syntax) or add formatting directly via buttons (like a document editor), instead of having to look up the documentation on how to do so every time.

The benefits of this tool may be, and are not restricted to, the following:
- Allows for quick testing and experimenting with MarkBind for users
- Allows developers to quickly test if new changes are working
- If we can link this up to GitHub CI/CD, this can make PR testing for components a lot quicker and easier

Of course, going to the PR branch, pulling the changes (or using `gh` CLI tool), and creating test sites to test new changes is still available. `markbind serve -d` allows for live preview of MarkBind sites. Therefore, this issue is **not urgent or mandatory**, given that all of these can already be done. However, I still think that consolidating the testing process into a single tool, and integrating it into GitHub CI/CD, will be more than beneficial for MarkBind in the long term.

Note: #572 is not relevant; the title seems so, but #572 focuses more on within MarkBind sites.

For the original issue, I am unsure if there is still a need to show minimized panels on one line, given that users can always alternate towards popover components instead. And given that we have ways to [hide minimized panels for print view](https://markbind.org/userGuide/reusingContents.html#optimizing-the-print-view), introduced into the User Guide in 2019 (after discussion on this issue died down), I am wondering if the issue is still relevant @damithc?

As was mentioned in the semi-duplicate issue #2666, to add on some features that may require us to use either a more sophisticated tool or a custom tool entirely, separate from codesandbox.io:

- The IDE can help add in components (e.g. add in the table syntax) or add formatting directly via buttons (like a document editor), instead of having to look up the documentation on how to do so every time.
- GitHub CI/CD Integration for PR testing will make things a lot easier and quicker for testing new features / bug fixes related to components.

@tlylt After reading through the issue chain, the suggested team set-up and workflow make sense! 

I believe that the necessary changes to the current team set-up is yet to be done - shall we go ahead with it to test it out for this semester @tlylt @damithc? As of right now, we definitely need to update the teams (e.g. cs3281 and cs3282 developers teams are outdated), so it would be a good idea to implement the suggestions in this thread and assess its effectiveness at the end of the semester.

After some thought and moving people around into different teams, I have the following proposal:

Teams:

- admin: admin access, for mentors and team leads (selected cs3282 students)
   - release managers: admin access, for selected 3282 students who will be making new releases
- developers: push access, for cs3282 students (past and present)
   - junior developers: push access, for cs3281 students (after recess week)
- contributors: triage access, for all contributors to MarkBind
  - active contributors: triage access, for all active contributors

Initially I wanted to try this approach:

> CS3281 students gradually gain more access to the repository as they become more familiar with it, so it is easier to make them part of a team and adjust the permissions for the whole group as the timeline dictates.

But given that GitHub child teams inherit the permissions of the parent teams, this means that CS3281 students will have to be placed in a completely new team separate from contributors and senior developers (with triage and push access respectively), as we don't want to change the permissions for non-CS3281 contributors to push access, or for senior developers to triage access.

So now we are following this approach:

> I think keeping the number of teams small and remove/add members to the teams with correct permission might be easier to follow.

Workflows:

- Non-CS328X developers:
  - When a developer non-trivially contributes to MarkBind, they can be added into the contributors team. 
  - When a developer contributes multiple times to MarkBind and is active, they can be added into the active contributors child team.
- CS3281 students:
  - CS3281 students will first be added into the contributors team before the semester begins (if they have contributed to MarkBind).
  - They will be added to the contributors team and the active contributors child team once the semester begins. This will allow them to be pinged. 
  - At the end of the recess week, we often give more permissions to CS3281 students for them to start managing; this is when they will be added to the junior developers child team, with push access. 
  - At the end of the semester, they will be moved from the junior developers child team to the developers team.
  - At the end of each CS3281 semester (and beginning of each CS3281 semester), the junior developers team should be empty.
- CS3282 students:
  - CS3282 students should begin in the developers team, following the above approach; a few (or all) from a batch will be selected to be mentors and/or release managers, and will be added to the admin and/or release managers teams accordingly.

@tlylt @kaixin-hc @damithc does this approach make sense? We could also potentially make it even clearer by renaming "developers" to "CS328X" and "junior developers" to "CS3281", since these two teams (with push access) would pretty much only be used for CS328X students (past and present).

> I have some concerns over active devs being a sub team of contributors, I think it will very easily be confused with the developer team. A rename to active contributors would prevent this.

That makes sense & aligns with the "developer vs contributor" differences we are going for here. I've edited the team names in the previous comment to highlight this more clearly.

> What permissions are given + the workflow for moving people should be documented both in the team description as well as a convenient place on the developer guide.

We'll definitely need to write down the timeline and the steps for doing so, to make sure that this is actively done by the new CS3282 students and the outgoing CS3282 students every batch!

The GitHub organization teams have been set as proposed, and the proposed workflow was followed over the semester somewhat. All we now need to do is to document the steps, and see how it works for the subsequent batches & modify the steps as needed.

Hi @WillCWX, as you mentioned `siteConvertLayout.njk` is capable of generating a `default.md` when we are converting an existing site to MarkBind, i.e. using `markbind init --convert` and calling `Site.convert()` as you have pointed out.

At this juncture, I fully agree with @ang-zeyu that we can consider potential differences in behavior between `markbind init` and `markbind init --convert` only when the need arises. So yes, having `siteConvertLayout.njk` be the default generator for `default.md` makes sense. 

> With a few changes to the behavior of `Site.convert()` and its helper functions, we maybe able to reuse them for something like `Site.init()` that would generate `default.md` with no need for copying of existing files.

Key points to take note would be:

1. Making sure that the `default.md` generated by `siteConvertLayout.njk` is the same as the current [`default.md`](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/template/default/_markbind/layouts/default.md)
2. Making sure there are no unintentional changes in generated `default.md` due to nunjucks behaviour (an example is the generation of blank lines that were fixed in #2278)

> This way may also result in the possibility of choosing templates to convert to in the future.

Currently we only have the default and the minimal template, but yes, that is a potential plus 👍 

> On the same lines if we can share layouts with the docs folder (and anywhere else), I think it'll be a huge plus for the amount of layout files we have to maintain as well.

Also, @ang-zeyu, was the reason for the `d.moderate` tagging because of this?

If you want to open a PR that tackles this issue, please feel free to!

> The lazy way to do this seems to be just statically place the existing `default.md` navigations into `siteConvertLayout.njk` and then make `Site.buildNav()` ignore these files. 

I assume you mean to do it in a manner similar to how `siteConvertLayout.njk` (and relevant parts of `Site/index.ts`) implements the `defaultFooter`? Not entirely sure what you mean here...

> Though that would mean any changes to the default template's filenames would require changing both `siteConvertLayout.njk` and `Site.buildNav()`.

That should be fine - I would imagine it's a matter of documentation.

> To make it somewhat sane, we might need a file that export template navigation constants.

Good idea! `Site/template.ts` might be a good place to store these (or a new file - we can decide later). 

> The most annoying part of the generation is probably the `* Topic 3 :expanded:` and the `[Home :house:]`. Otherwise, the navigation can just be generated normally as it is now. 
> 
> The even lazier/better way may be to remove both `* Topic 3 :expanded:` and `[Home :house:]` altogether

I believe we can simply set something like `defaultSiteNav` to conditionally generate either the default one or the custom one (in case of conversion)?

As I mentioned in the linked comment, if we were to implement an auto-generated title, the best way to do this would be to extract the file name, capitalize it (and perhaps some further processing like removing underscores `_`), and use it as the page title. While MKDocs and Jekyll have played around with this idea, there doesn't seem to be a good way to make sure that a proper title is extracted in all scenarios, though we can probably start small (e.g. implementing just the capitalization).

Note that #2166 discussed this in the context of empty titles (i.e. no titles are provided in either the `frontmatter` or `site.json`), but this issue can be expanded to cover other scenarios. Of course, this would require our title auto-generation to be robust.

At the moment we do not have a pressing need for auto-generated title, but it may be very useful for those who want to convert a large set of documents into MarkBind & define a new sensible title for each of the pages. 

(Maybe we can even consider a CLI command flag for `markbind init --convert` that can take in a regex for title generation? Just a thought)

> My personal experience would be that a simple relationship of file name -&gt; page title doesn't work well for blog articles as the name of an article can be quite long. However, not everyone likes file names to be long.
> 
> Creating a page title containing proper capitalization and special characters and then translating that into a file name just so that it is auto-converted back into the intended form may not be an ideal experience.

Right, we'll need to ensure that if this feature was to be implemented, it would have to be as an optional feature.

> I agree, definitely useful for the mass conversion case. For example, if a site has a number of files each containing a coding question. Then, converting `question/1.md` and `question/2.md` into `Question 1` & `Question 2` (or some other variants) might be helpful.

Yes, I would imagine that the user should be able to specify a flag like `--auto-title` and maybe specify a directory / directories for title auto-generation, like: `markbind init --convert --auto-title docs/questions/ docs/answers/`, which will automatically generate a title for all the files under the specified directories.

This would be a feature intended for mass-conversion, and to allow flexibility, we can consider extending this feature in the future to allow pre-defined regex / title formats.

We could alternatively use `--address` with the short form `-a`, which is still available for the `serve` command. `--dev-addr` and `-a` like MKDocs might also work, but `--address` might be more straightforward as long as we document it properly [here](https://markbind.org/userGuide/cliCommands.html#serve-command).

In terms of the template itself, I think we can refer to it as the AB3 template instead of the CS2103 template (and the command will be `markbind init --template ab3` accordingly) - [AB3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) is part of the [SE-EDU](https://se-education.org/) initiative which [MarkBind falls under](https://se-education.org/docs/tools.html), whereas CS2103 is NUS-specific and may seem odd to non-NUS users as @itsyme pointed out.

In terms of the general software documentation, I think we can consider this as a separate issue, since it would require more research into what would constitute a minimal yet useful set of features for general software documentation. It would also be good to refer to what other tools (E.g. Jekyll, Docusaurus, etc.) have in place for this (if any).

So perhaps for this issue #2384, we can reduce the scope to just focus on the ab3 template 👍

[`tough-cookie@5.0.0`](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v5.0.0) onwards has removed their `psl` dependency, which generates the `punycode` deprecation warning.

`whatwg-url@9.0.0` onwards has also removed their `punycode` dependency, removing the deprecation warning, as per [here](https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/issues/275).

The problem here seems to be `eslint`, which is dpeending on `uri-js`, whose PR for `punycode` deprecation is still open and is [entertaining to read through](https://github.com/garycourt/uri-js/pull/95).

In terms of the Node LTS Error message, we can move the bulk of the comment (and maybe a bit more details from the GitHub issue, instead of just linking the issue itself) to the ["Troubleshooting"](https://markbind.org/userGuide/troubleshooting.html) section. We can also truncate this current comment and link the ["Troubleshooting"](https://markbind.org/userGuide/troubleshooting.html) subsection on the error directly.

In terms of guidance on npm and node installation, as @damithc suggested, linking the npm and node installation pages for each of the supported OSes should be sufficient.

This is a simple tooltip that appears on hover (that does not require explicit actions from users to close since it auto-closes). This would also make it a straightforward UI improvement - I think allowing users to toggle this on / off might be a bit of an overkill.

> Also, I was thinking if it would be good to have a popover that appears when hovered indicating the action of the button. This is because although the copy button might be intuitive, the text wrap button might not be very intuitive to readers.

Agreed - this would be a good general improvement for many of our buttons (and might be great for accessibility even).

After reading this section through, it seems that the feature itself is not the issue, rather the way we provide the examples is slightly confusing. 

> The first option is indicated as a correct option but lacks correct as a parameter

The question for this example is asking for: which of the options **contradicts** the heuristics recommended? 

The idea is that the first option is **correct**, meaning that it **does not contradict** the heuristics recommended, hence **not the correct option to be chosen here**. The question is intended to be single-answer, with the 4th option being the correct answer.

The tip (for multiple correct answers) that follows the question is standalone, and there is no example provided for this.

So the UG example is also actually correct. The issue is not in the correctness here, but in the wording. I think we just need to make the following documentation changes:

1. Re-word the reasoning for the first option from "correct" to "does not contradict the heuristics recommended".
2. Provide another example of a question with multiple correct options.

> Would it be better if this was left as a tip instead? Though allowed, according to proper heuristics, if there are multiple correct answers, users should choose to use a checkbox question instead of a multiple choice question.

I don't think this is true for all cases - I would consider an MCQ question with multiple correct answers vs. a Checkbox question with multiple correct answers to be two different use cases. (The first case might be useful if a question setter wants to be more "lenient" in a textbook quiz)

Leaving it as a tip is likely not going to cause huge problems per se, but given that (1) this issue was raised since the tip was initially thought to refer to the example above the tip, and (2) we can have more examples as needed (we are doing it for the [Fill-in-the-Blanks Questions section](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/others.html#fill-in-the-blanks-questions)), it might be worthwhile to at least clear up the potential confusion.

If providing an example seems to be overkill, we can expand / reword the tip so that there is no ambiguity, i.e. make it clear that the example shown is meant to be a single-answer question.

I think in general, when the cursor changes to a pointer, I would expect the UI component to be clickable (and it would do something on click). 

Point taken though, I wonder if there are other alternatives we could look into for not just annotations, but similar components? E.g. changing the cursor to a question mark on hover? (Wouldn't be my first choice either, just an example.)

> Though, i think it could be relevant to make the documentation a bit more user friendly and add ' raw ' ``{`` content ``}`` ``{``v-pre``}`` ' endraw ' to use it as a raw string by itself.

Definitely, we can & should do this.

> Also maybe it is worth pointing this specific bug out in troubleshooting? Rather than tips and tricks. I also think it could be helpful to add a FAQ or expand the troubleshooting session? as when making new markbind sites and deploying github pages I keep troubleshooting the same rookie mistakes like not updating baseURL to site.json, branch change from master to main, or adding ``{`` baseurl ``}`` to diagrams etc. etc. ?

That's a good point - perhaps we can simply merge the troubleshooting and the tips and tricks sections into a single "Troubleshooting & FAQs" section? And maybe re-organize it for better flow. We should do this if, as you say, at the moment both pages are mostly used for troubleshooting anyway.

I think there are two points that need to be addressed:

1. There are some subsections, namely the [raw-endraw](https://markbind.org/userGuide/tipsAndTricks.html#using-raw-endraw-to-display-content) and the [deployment](https://markbind.org/userGuide/tipsAndTricks.html#configuring-online-deployment-platforms-to-use-specific-markbind-version) subsections, that might also cause errors that lead users to visit the troubleshooting section instead. For this, we could `include` these subsections in the troubleshooting section.

2. Relating to this part in particular:

> I also think it could be helpful to add a FAQ or expand the troubleshooting session? as when making new markbind sites and deploying github pages I keep troubleshooting the same rookie mistakes like not updating baseURL to site.json, branch change from master to main, or adding ``{`` baseurl ``}`` to diagrams etc. etc. ?

It might be useful to have a general section (like a summary / tl;dr section for setups) that contains common issues / reminders when setting up pages. If we want the troubleshooting section to be a section where users rarely go, then we might need another section for this (a page where we want users to frequently use, essentially). I think this idea is in line with previous discussions in #2257 and for #2459. This was why I initially suggested consolidating the troubleshooting & tips and tricks section, but since they do serve different purposes, it might be better to have a separate section for this.

---

It'd be better to keep the scope of this particular issue to point 1, but I think point 2 brings up another aspect of the user documentation that we can address going forward.

Agreed that it should wrap at word boundaries instead of character level! I think for the implementation, we'll need to consider:

1. Behavior for printing
2. Edge cases that may arise

@damithc It seems that the issue might not be related to the Vue 3 migration; see [this issue](https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg/issues/440) on `unpkg`, where similar issues occurred across all the packages using `unpkg`. From what I can tell, this issue just happened to overlap in time with our Vue 3 migration testing, so this issue was not necessary to be solved for v6. Hence the suggestion by @Tim-Siu.

They have reported that the issue with `unpkg` was potentially caused by an internal migration that `unpkg` also happened to be working on, and it has since been resolved, so the issue shouldn't re-occur.

I guess the question would be, should we bundle `unpkg`? If this is a one-time issue with `unpkg`, I'm not sure if we can justify bundling it for the sake of the CORS issue. The bundling for mermaid just to support offline functionalities is still an open issue under #2548, so we could potentially move the discussion there instead and close this issue.

When I initially suggested the feature [here](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2648#issuecomment-2756926293), I was actually thinking of a component attribute for the cardstack component's main filtering (e.g. `&lt;cardstack searchable blocks="2" logic="AND">`). Having a button for toggling this also can work, but my main concern is that this won't see much use since the use case of the card stack will determine if OR or AND is better for the logic. 

I don't mind having a button alongside this, though. Maybe the `logic` attribute can take "AND", "OR", or "BOTH" as values & we can add in the button if "BOTH" is specified? Just throwing ideas out there.

@Incogdino What do you think is a better approach?

Per the error message,

```
Gradle detected a problem with the following location: 'D:\a\RepoSense\RepoSense\build\jacoco\test.exec'. Reason: Task ':coverage' uses this output of task ':test' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency. This can lead to incorrect results being produced, depending on what order the tasks are executed.
```

it seems the fix to your issue is to declare an explicit dependency for the predefined task 'test'. This follows from coverage using 'test' to know the amount of coverage.

As for the second issue, I did some Googling online. Perhaps [this](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/5898) may help?

Hope this helps you fix the issues you are facing!

reiterating with @sopa301 on point 1, you can edit the issue to add on to the tasks to resolve since they are both in the same overarching theme of "outdated DG for learning the basics" rather than creating two separate issues, it can make the issues board "unhygenic" and cluttered over time

Since the issues are already created it is fine, we will close both issues once the PR is merged, but do take note in the future.

Reiterating on @sopa301 's point 3, we will only merge the PR after the relevant conventions has been complied to so do make the changes!

i think it would be better to move this into it's own page entirely.

then reference that page in customisingReport.md

a thing to take note is that because this is an easier way, do make sure to make a note of that on both the new pages and the customisingReport.md that this is meant to make it easier to use a config, something that mentions it is a new "in between" way of using reposense. it sits between CLI (meant for quick tryouts) and CSV file format (Experienced user)

~~I'm still not fully certain of why the additional model is needed rather than using the already present, it'll be great if there's a reason to help me understand, e.g. why there is a need for ReportAuthorDetails vs the pre-existing Author, how does it help as it seems to be just a subset of Author and is present only to store in-memory!~~ nvm i see it's just a model to use the yml quickly, my apologies, given that we haven't really had hierarchical data in reposense and it differed alot from what we have this looked amiss to me

And if so, I think it'll be good if we can compare and look towards code portfolio page, i.e., if this new set of inputs will be helpful building (and more optimal than the two existing solutions in CLI and CSV) towards the personal portfolio features since these inputs are from what I can see, a middle ground between CLI and CSV inputs. That way we can possibly justify the additional model better.

Apart from that, I think a system test for the new set of inputs is needed much like what we have for both LocalRepoSystemTest and ConfigSystemTest since they are E2E tests using different styles of inputs.

This issue happened due to a misconfiguration during my semester of CS3281 (2023) and went unnoticed for a while. At that time, I felt like this was a possible and common issue. I raised this up because I think it is worthy to just add a warning. I believe no logic change is needed.

There is a mismatch in the `summary.json` file produced by the test. We can look into which should be the correct results given the test scenario.

Beyond pinning to `ubuntu-22.04` as a temporary fix, we can also look into adding a step to use venv to resolve the root issue which was introduced in [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/).

In my opinion, we should not remove this feature. We should continue allowing repo-granularity since dates and until dates.
  - I think it makes little sense to remove all the work done in #2281. I recall the initial plan was to use it for trimming but ever since we have the trimming done in the front end, it seemed underutilized. That being said, I think it is still a good feature to keep. 
    1) Allows for more flexibility for users, use cases maybe we haven't thought of. 
    2) The work is already done anyway. 
    3) #2217 This is still a requested feature
    - A possible use case for this is that users could possibly want to omit all commits prior to a certain date just for one repo. For example, limiting the scope of commits to just Week 1 to Week 13 of a school semester. Any commits done before Week 1 doesn't count for credit, any done after Week 13 doesn't count for credit.
  - Yes, it will require us to deconflict between CLI and CSV input, and the interactions that will happen on the front end for trimming and filtering for both normal mode and portfolio mode. But I think this can be deconflicted. Scenarios will need to be noted down. Definitions (like trimming) will also need to be noted down in the reference.

### Deconflicting between CLI `--since`, `--until` flags and CSV per repo `Since Date`, `Until Date`

#### Overlapping dates

> There may be a case which repos specified hardcoded time ranges that are non-overlapping and far away from one another.

Suppose a date range A-B-C-D:

For these overlapping cases, I think they are user misconfigurations and should be treated as such. It doesn't make sense for the user to use `--since A --until C` and `Since Date: B`,`Until Date: D`. Is this the overlapping case you are talking about? What would make sense is for the user to either 1) expand the CLI flags `--until` to cover date range until D, or 2) reduce the CSV `Until Date` to C.

For this case, we will throw an error from the backend and stop thet report generation since this is a user input error. We can then give a meaningful error message in the veins of: `Error: you specified in CLI a date range of --SINCE to --UNTIL, but your CSV config specifies a date range that extends outside --SINCE or --UNTIL. Either modify your CLI flags or your CSV date range.`

In summary, basically, CLI flags are used for the main bulk of the report generation, the CSV is just used to **limit the date range, not expand the date range beyond what's expected**. Our invariant is that the CLI flags must always be a superset of the CSV flags. An illustration of what I mentioned:

<img width="589" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a02b936-25d7-4e42-aaac-cd09a5abac58" />

Side note: What is the current behavior regarding using CSV dates that falls outside the range of CLI dates, given the implemented feature in #2281? We might need to throw an error for that as that seems like an undefined behavior and should not be the case. 

#### Using CSV dates without using CLI date flags

Considering our default if we don't specify any CLI date flags. We use --since to be one month before the current date.

If the user specifies CSV dates without CLI date flags, I propose we can handle this by checking all the date ranges and finding the earliest start date and latest end date of all the repos, then we generate our report based on that inferred date range. We also let the user know with a warning: `You did not specify CLI date range but specified CSV date range. We will infer the maximum from the CSV date range given.`

#### How will it work with trim and filter in the FE?

By default I believe filter dates works based off the input --since and --until or whatever's inferred. So this shouldn't be impacted. 

As for trim, I think it is necessary to establish a definition of what it means, and we will use the current definition: first commit and last commit, and this is still possible since the CSV dates only serves to limit our date range of commits.

#### Inputs:

Requesting your inputs: @damithc Will this logic possibly detrack too far from the original intention? Since we are technically using the Since Date and Until Date in the CSV as limits if we do use the CLI flags (though if we don't use the CLI flags, this will serve the original intention of allowing multiple date for different repos, just that every repo requires a date range/otherwise should be inferred from the inputs.

Please help me see if i am missing any potential edge cases and also sanity for FE. Are there any considerations on FE side I may be missing?: @sopa301 @jonasongg @Airiinnn 

As the implementer, can you check if the logic is sound or needs further refinement? @CYX22222003 All these will need to be documented.

**All in all, I believe we can handle all these via aborting the RepoSense run if it is misconfigured, or warning the user if it is not a misconfiguration as in the case of no CLI flag inputs. It shouldn't be too difficult a change implementation wise.**

> I believe that Si Kai was proposing that the CSV date ranges are meant to further restrict the range of commits to send to the frontend (correct me if I'm wrong), which is why the range must be a subrange of the CLI date range. 

This is correct.

i think the logic between `c-summary-charts` and `c-ramp` is getting a bit complicated! i think we should either:
1. pass in `this.isPortfolio` and `this.optimiseTimeline` from `c-summary-charts` to `c-ramp`, and calculate `sdate` and `udate` accordingly inside `c-ramp`
2. or calculate all the above in `c-summary-charts`

either way, to replace `getUnoptimised...` and `getOptimised...`, let's push all the calculating logic inside functions called `getIndicatedMinimumDate` and `getIndicatedMaximumDate` (because they'll handle not just optimise timeline anymore), and we can write it something like:
```
if (this.optimiseTimeline)
  return user.commits.reduce...
if (this.isPortfolio && user.sinceDate)
  return user.sinceDate
return this.filterSinceDate
```
and to decide whether to display the date indicators, we should have a computed property `isDisplayDateIndicators` that returns `this.optimiseTimeline || this.isPortfolio`

this would also make sure you handle the case where isPortfolio is true, but the repo-specific since/until date is not specified

let me know if you've any questions!

@Airiinnn yep, i think we can leave that refactoring for another PR! and since user.sinceDate will always be present when isPortfolio === true (based on backend behaviour), LGTM. we can merge this once #2340 is merged and you're done with the changes above :)

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
When running Cypress tests on a local machine (`./gradlew frontendTest` or otherwise), certain tests such as in `optimiseTimeline` will fail as the time zone of Singapore is different from that of the GitHub runner, and the tests are currently configured to pass on GitHub. This causes confusion to new contributors when running Cypress tests. Let's change this behaviour such that tests will pass on both local machines and on GitHub.

### If possible, describe the solution
There could be some Cypress configs that allow changing the time zone the tests are run in. Otherwise, some other workaround to ensure the tests that fail purely because of this time zone issue pass on local machines will work as well.

The Cypress tests on CI fail without that enabled. I can't really recall the cause of the failure since it was quite a while ago and the logs are not retrievable. Perhaps we could investigate this with more detail in another PR?

@sikai00 Currently, [we don't have any](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2000). This move is partly to facilitate the inclusion of unit tests to our workflow for better coverage, as well as provide a supply of first-timer issues.

As for the other test runners, Cypress doesn't seem to have a problem as it still passes the CI.

Hi Prof @damithc, you'll just need to update the `main` branches of the `publish-RepoSense` forks that the dashboards are deployed from. If they're deployed via another method, do let me know so I can find a solution.

Hi @joeng03, thanks for the PR! For consistency with the other PRs, could you kindly follow the conventions set by the other PRs? To help you ease into the workflow, I'll point out a few things:
1. The PR should be from your fork, not from a separate branch on the main repository.
2. Title naming convention should be [#ISSUE_NUMBER] (brief description of PR) .
3. The PR should include a recommended commit message that follows the [guidelines ](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html).

Once the conventions have been adhered to, give me a ping and I'll bump your PR for your fellow developers to review!

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

Good work on your first PR! A few minor nitpicks:
1. Since both issues are concerning the same task (updating the outdated docs that contain deprecated classes), it would be cleaner to merge the issues in the future, though that's just my preference.
2. It might be more convenient for future members if the commit message body could briefly explain why the docs are being updated.
3. The naming of the PR title should follow the convention [#ISSUE_NUMBER] (short brief of PR)

Does this mean we still need the `netlify.toml` file to deploy? If so, I think the PR in `publish-RepoSense` will be needed. Can you reopen that one? You can modify this part to remove the reference to adding the `netlify.toml` file.

Note that Netlify has a low limit for free tier users (only 300 _build minutes_ per month as at June 2020 -- a single report generation can take 2-3 build minutes, longer if your report includes many/big repositories). Due to this, we will not be supporting this method going forward.

Honestly, the need to install Java each time isn't that big of a deal since we can probably cache it, but the fact that Github Actions is as good, is native, and is completely free makes Netlify really unappealing.

If you're not sure if your documentation updates look right, you can push the documentation code to your main branch, which by default will build the documentation for you to preview.

For now, I think it would be good to remove the empty box.

Good work on tackling this issue! I've just a few comments:
1. Could you update the documentation under "Customising Reports" as well? You could consider putting the One-Stop Config between "Customize using CLI flags" and "Customize using CSV config files" as it lies between both in terms of complexity.
2. I noticed a few lines (especially in the equals() methods) aren't covered by tests. Could you cover those?

Documentation-wise, looks largely okay. Perhaps we could be a bit more deliberate with our file structure and use of headings:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f37257-ace5-4277-83fe-3f5daebc110c)

For example, our `Advanced Report Configuration` should be the last major header in the page, so the `Field Descriptions` should be at the same level of the complete example. 

Our headings should also follow the same style, so if we're keeping `Further customizing your report` as a heading, we should capitalize it.

I kinda like number 3. I think it's really unusual for a user to deliberately put invalid date ranges, so we can be fairly certain it's an unintended error, and using red text would make it easier to identify.

Perhaps we could rewrite this part while we're modifying this line. We don't use a separate branch for our frontend tests anymore.

LGTM, with some minor comments. We can leave the refactoring for another issue since this feature's quite high priority. Notably, the error message boxes, functions and styles are duplicated when they logically follow the non-portfolio version. Could I trouble you to create the issue for that, thanks!

Since this is a big feature with significant changes, let's have one more reviewer to ensure things are all good

### The problem
With the move to Java 11, the current instructions to deploy to Netlify no longer work as the default build image only has Java 8.


### If possible, describe the solution
Add code to install Java 11 manually if the build system does not currently support it.


&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->


### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered
Discontinue support for Netlify deployments.
&lt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.
-->


### Additional context
[A discussion on potential native Java 11 support](https://answers.netlify.com/t/java-11-support/67078/19)

On a side note, the [Netlify deployment for RepoSense](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reposense/deploys) has been down since March 2024.

Prof @damithc  I signed up with ryanpoon301@gmail.com.

@CYX22222003 seems doable, as long as it's not too difficult for the user to replicate.
You can refer to [this](https://reposense.org/ug/sharingReports.html#appendix-reposense-with-netlify) to see the current user guide for deploying on Netlify. We should aim to make it at least as easy to deploy to Netlify. Do let me know your thoughts on the feasibility of this task.

On a much lower priority, we also have a [Netlify deployment](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reposense/deploys) and it would be nice to restore it, though it doesn't serve much purpose other than as proof that the Netlify deployment method works.

@CYX22222003 We've decided to put Netlify support on lower priority, so we'll need to modify the UG to match:
- Update the [Netlify appendix](https://reposense.org/ug/withNetlify.html) with the new instructions, with a warning that this method will not be supported going forward.
- Update [this page](https://reposense.org/ug/generatingReports.html#generating-reports-remotely) to recommend Github Actions instead of Netlify
- Change other references as needed.

We've also decided to drop the Netlify deployment on RepoSense for the reasons discussed above.

Perhaps another angle would be to expand this feature by adding an option to base the colouring on a time unit e.g. day (as is currently), week, month, year. This would make it easier for the user to set the granularity they want to see, and there is further opportunity for customisation by the report maker.

As for the potential confusion with the file types, we could look into defining colour schemes so they appear visually distinct.

I agree that it would be nice to support CSV dates and the dynamic date range at the same time, as it essentially allows report viewers to view data ranges of interest. Using the backend to ensure that the ranges are validated would ensure we don't have empty charts, which I can't imagine a scenario where we would need them. An implemented behaviour for the frontend in #2303 would be to display an error message, but I agree that this could be caught earlier during report generation.

From my knowledge of the frontend, there should be no problem, since we only receive 1 set of `sinceDate` and `untilDate` per repo and 1 set for the overall report via `summary.json`.

Though, regarding the amount of effort and time to implement this on the backend, I'm not sure if it's feasible within the remainder of the semester. 

Since we already have implementations for the simplified behaviour, perhaps we could merge those first and collect user data, before we commit to the more comprehensive solution?

I believe that Si Kai was proposing that the CSV date ranges are meant to further restrict the range of commits to send to the frontend (correct me if I'm wrong), which is why the range must be a subrange of the CLI date range. So therefore on the frontend, those commits outside of the CSV date ranges essentially don't exist in the report, and so the filter range takes priority as usual. This is based off one interpretation of #2217, where "different time periods" means to limit the range of commits to different time periods per repo. The other interpretation would be to view "different time periods" as to fix the viewable range to fixed time periods, indicated via the CSV file, which is what #2340 does with the portfolio mode.

I also think it's worth separating users into report generators and report viewers, given that this is made with code portfolios in mind. I think it's reasonable that report generators will want to exclude certain commits from viewers, which Si Kai's solution would allow.

Regarding the potentially misleading configuration, it is up to the report generator to ensure this does not happen. Assuming that the generator is not malicious and is informed about the extension period (as an instructor should be in your example), then the buffer should be added manually without issue.

Regarding the behaviour for non portfolio mode, it should be synced with portfolio mode (unless there is a reason to diverge). We can replicate the behaviour from #2340 by setting the filter range to the dates from the viewer perspective. I'm not really sure if there's a scenario where we want to fix the viewable range that cannot be replicated by removing commits outside of the range, while still allowing the filter range feature.

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 29 01:07:23]%%

Let's go with having the CSV file define the range of commits to fetch per repo. This way, we can avoid massive changes to frontend logic and allow our portfolio PR to proceed. So the behaviour will be as such per repo:

1. CSV line present, CLI present: Range of commits will be taken from CSV line, and CSV line will be validated against CLI line.
2. CSV line present, CLI absent: Range of commits taken from CSV line. Overall range is the union of all ranges across CSV-specified repos.
3. CSV line absent (already implemented): Range of commits taken from CLI (if any, else default values for CLI)

Behaviour for the other views (e.g. Author, Chart, None) should remain the same since this is a backend change.

There are edge cases for partial information provided (e.g. start date/end date only):
For CSV lines:
- If start date provided only, end date will be either 1: CLI end date if given, or 2: latest date across all CSV-specified repos
- If end date provided only, start date will be either 1: CLI start date if given, or 2: earliest date across all CSV-specified repos

CLI defaults without any CSV dates specified remain the same. We will raise warnings for any behaviour that diverges from CLI defaults (e.g. when CSV dates are specified but CLI is not)

This means the following actions will be taken:
- #2320 to be merged
- New PR to validate CSV inputs and make inferences where relevant to be created (#2340).

Does anyone have any thoughts/objections/suggestions?

P.S.:

> Also, if we're going with the filter range priority for default view, can I confirm that in portfolio mode, it should be handled 
> differently and the date indicators displayed are the individual repository date ranges (as how it is implemented in #2340)?

@Airiinnn, I forgot that portfolio mode removes the in-report date range filter, so there is actually a reason to diverge from default mode behaviour. My bad :P

> I have some questions regarding the suggestions. For case 1 and case 2, how to handle the case where only one of the `--since` flag and `--until` flag is provided. 

If there's only one flag, we can use this:

There are edge cases for partial information provided (e.g. start date/end date only): For CSV lines:
   If start date provided only, end date will be either 1: CLI end date if given, or 2: latest date across all CSV-specified repos

Do let me know if I've missed anything out.

> Furthermore, do we need to consider the existence of `--period` flag?

We can derive the start and end dates using the `--period` flag, and apply the normal logic as usual.

>Automerging defaults to using Pull Requests (automergeType="pr"). In that case Renovate first creates a branch and associated Pull Request, and then automerges the PR on a subsequent run once it detects the PR's status checks are "green". If by the next run the PR is already behind the base branch it will be automatically rebased, because Renovate only automerges branches which are up-to-date and green. If Renovate is scheduled for hourly runs on the repository but commits are made every 15 minutes to the main branch, then an automerge like this will keep getting deferred with every rebase.

We'll have to wait for a day where there's no merges in the previous day to check if the current config works properly.

For now, I'll merge the ones that pass CI to free up our CI resources.

From the way I see it, the state of the report and the configurations should match at all times. We should change the behaviour in one of two ways:
1. (Recommended) Ensure the groups are merged after a change in the search bar. I don't recall any principles being enforced for the current implementation, so maybe someone else can chime in. Otherwise, it's up to the implementer to decide the implementation.
2. (Easier, but introduces feature flaw) Uncheck the `merge all groups` checkbox after each search is applied.

For classification purposes, I'd agree that this is a bug, since the groups aren't merged as it claimed to be.

This batch processing needs better error handling, this implementation essentially ignores any errors. I understand that this is for the first input form. Perhaps a better way to do this is push back to the invalid lines upon error and show an error toast to indicate that the creation of certain requests.

hi @CameronMooreGit do update the failing tests, you most likely would need to update the snapshots. Also agree with the comment above, do try to use Bootstrap classes instead of raw CSS.

I think localStorage related methods (parsing for the item, updating the item and deleting the item) can be extracted into their own function(s). Would make it easier to maintain as these are used quite a few times here, for e.g. if we want to change the key from "autosave" to something else.

Thanks for the PR, I think this is a really neat feature to have, but I have some comments on it.

Upon testing, it seems that the autosave works on the preview setting (preview as student) as well, however the reset button doesnt work in preview mode, and I'd have to manually delete the data for it to clear. I've attached a video snippet for your reference (apologies for the bad quality, had to fit it within 10mb, let me know if its too hard to see and ill re-record). Since this is just for previews, one method would be to disable this autosave mechanism when the feedback session is being previewed.

I think standardizing the copies to have 'Copy of' prepended by default is okay, since the instructor would be able to edit this name in the modal, but @damithc would you like to weigh in on this change?

@damithc thanks for the input Prof, I think that's a fair approach to take for this

@Respirayson could you implement it as described above? So there shouldn't be a 'Copy of' prepended but rather a warning/error within the popup when the name and course are the same

Based on this branching, it is possible that the body contains the message for not having a `Fixes #<issue-number>` as well as the message for not addressing an open issue right? I would assume logic should work  something like this:
- If isDescriptionValid is false, it means the PR description doesn't contain a valid reference to an issue number.
- If isIssueOpen is checking whether the referenced issue is open (assuming it was implemented correctly), it wouldn't be able to perform this check if there's no valid issue reference in the description.

Based on the above, a more logical flow should look something like:

- Check if the description is valid (contains a proper issue reference)
- Only if the description is valid, then fetch and check the state of the referenced issue (I believe the issue number can be extracted using capture groups)

To use a capture group, the extraction process might look something like this (this is just an example, do test it out and verify)

```
const descriptionRegex = /(?:[Ff]ix(?:es|ed)?|[Cc]lose(?:s|d)?|[Rr]esolve(?:s|d)?|[Pp]art [Oo]f) #(\d+)/;
const extractIssueNum = (description) => ``{``
  const match = description.match(descriptionRegex);
  return match ? match[1] : null;
``}``;
const issueNumber = extractIssueNumber(pr.data.body);
```

I believe that this throws an error because it tries to cast a non-uuid formatted string to a UUID? If so, then the test name should reflect the intent accordingly; i.e. this should be named `testExecute_markNotificationWithInvalidNotificationId_shouldFail` or something similar. Additionally, would be good to also add a test that checks for something non-existent, i.e. a valid UUID will throw a EntityNotFoundException.

Additionally, I believe this error should be caught and formatted correctly, i.e. caught and re-thrown as an InvalidParametersException. You can create a new issue (and even a PR to handle this if you'd like) to track this. But I think the action should be refactored to use `getUuidFromString` instead of UUID.fromString. 

Meanwhile I'm ok with merging this PR with this current assertion (as a follow up PR will need to refactor this test anyway)

Same here, should investigate why this is throwing an NPE directly, when it should be throwing `InvalidParametersException` or something similar. You can raise another issue for this if you'd like too. Regardless, I'm also fine merging this in because this test will have to be updated when the over-arching issue is fixed.

@jasonqiu212 I think this a good way to do it, would make it significantly cleaner as well (additionally for tests that call getTypicalXXXX in each method) and standardized. I think it'd be great to adopt this method going forward, but I'm concerned about the currently open PRs with tests use one of the other approaches (call getTypicalXXXX or instantiate a new one in each test), how do you think we should handle those?

same as the other PR, if you want to test the grace period it can be in a different test. I think with the naming of the test, it should reflect a time that's in the future to avoid confusion

@InfinityTwo's observation observation is correct, because the cleanup of data after the SQL E2E tests are not very well done, and hence the data persists, so locally the behaviour may duffer due to old data. I think it's probably a larger overarching problem with the SQL E2E tests, hence I'm fine with leaving it as is, as it passes the current CI (where the testbed is expected to be clean)

Hmm I see where you're coming from, since `null` and `""` would trigger a `false` inside the `GoogleRecaptchaService`! I was thinking that this test would focus on the logic inside `SendLoginEmailAction` only, and the action does not do anything about the captcha response (unlike for `USER_EMAIL` and `CONTINUE_URL` where the action checks for null and etc)

So I think these 2 failure tests would be a bit redundant, as they will basically be identical to this current test. Also, we do have a `GoogleRecaptchaServiceTest` that tests for `null` and `""`. 

What do you think? @mingyang143

I was thinking that if we did add this: `String[] params = ``{``Const.ParamsNames.USER_EMAIL, "test@example.com"``}```, then the `isVerificationSuccessful()` method should return `false`, since the `USER_CAPTCHA_RESPONSE` is missing. And the action will end here, without reaching the check for missing `CONTINUE_URL`.

If we mocked `isVerificationSuccessful()` to return `true`, then the test would essentially test the same logic route as `______TS("Missing continueUrl parameter");`.

Good point! I also use the in-built testing interface in VS Code to run the unit tests individually. 

I am a bit hesitant to add a section for IDE features, because we do mention that we do not "actively support/maintain" IDE-based development [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/setting-up.html#step-4-start-developing). I think the rationale is that if we do start supporting IDE-based development, we will need to add instructions for most of the popular IDEs. And that can be quite costly for us to monitor IDE-specific updates/deprecations and maintain the docs

@mingyang143 What do you think? Or maybe we can just include a simple link?

Although extremely unlikely, there is a small probability that the random UUID actually turns out to be an existing id.

Following existing test cases, we can do this:
```
UUID nonexistentQuestionId = UUID.fromString("11110000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000");
```

I think the original test has 3 test cases:
1. `testExecute_noAccountsWithEmail_noAccountsFetched`
2. `testExecute_oneAccountWithEmail_accountFetched`
3. `testExecute_multipleAccountsWithEmail_multipleAccountsFetched`

Let's include all 3 to improve test coverage

if i'm not wrong, i think the 3 test cases require different test data (i.e., different input emails and different set of accounts). so I think we can getTypicalXXX individually in each test case, then modify the attributes accordingly. So we can remove the `prepareTestData` method and the instance variables `accounts` and `typicalAccount`

Then lastly modify the `when(...).thenReturn(...)` accordingly. For instance, for `testExecute_noAccountsWithEmail_noAccountsFetched`, I think it will look something like this:
```
when(mockLogic.getAccountsForEmail(email)).thenReturn(Collections.emptyList());
```

@domoberzin I was thinking more about this approach of defining a single typicalXXX object for all of the test cases. Since some test cases change the attributes of the typicalXXX object, it may lead to unexpected behavior/bugs for other tests and goes against the principle of having independent tests. Should they define the relevant typicalXXX objects within the test case methods instead?

From the already migrated unit tests, I see another approach being used:

```
private Instructor instructor;

@BeforeMethod
void setUp() ``{``
  instructor = new Instructor(...);
``}``
```

`@BeforeMethod` annotation executes `setUp()` before each test method within a test class. I see the merits of using this, since we can reduce LoC for common typicalXXX objects and keep it consistent with the migrated tests

Perhaps we can standardize using the following approach:
- For creating typicalXXX objects that are common for all test methods within a test class, follow the above approach of using a `setUp()` method, so that a fresh typicalXXX object is created for each test method
- For typicalXXX objects that are **not** common for all test methods, create them in the test methods.
- Creating typicalXXX objects should use `getTypicalXXX()`, rather than instantiating the object directly using `new` for consistency
- If a test method requires attribute modifications, they should be done in the test methods themselves.

As an example:

```
private Instructor instructor;

@BeforeMethod
void setUp() ``{``
  instructor = getTypicalInstructor();
``}``

@Test
void testExecute_typicalCase_success() ``{``
  instructor.setName(...);
  ...
``}``
```

@domoberzin Do you think this would be better?

String[] instructorParams = new String[] ``{`` Const.ParamsNames.ENTITY_TYPE, Const.EntityType.INSTRUCTOR, ``}``;

Oki, thanks for investigating this! Since archived courses are not fetched using SQL logic, I think it's okay to leave the current test case. After the migration, this test case will probably be useless, since it's relying on datastore logic

Hmm I think it would be better to reduce the number of data variables used here to improve readability. When reading over the test cases, it was a bit tough to keep track of the many data variables and their relationships. 

Suggestions:
- Perhaps we can identify common data variables that are used for most of the test cases? Then, for the additional data variables that are only used 1-2 times, we can create them inside the test cases?
- I think including the relationships inside the variable naming can help with readability! (e.g., `student1InCourse1`)

Was thinking if we can explore abstracting the access control tests in `sqlui/webapi/BaseActionTest.java`, like in the old tests. Currently, I feel like there's a lot of repeated code for testing access control

@InfinityTwo That would be great! thank you!!

Let's follow the previous method names (i.e., having 1 method for each role). I think this follows open-closed principle more (please correct me if i'm wrong..), since if we have additional user types, we just simply add a new method, and the old methods do not need to be modified. 

If we have 1 method for all roles, and pass in boolean parameters for each role, adding a new user type means we need to change all of the method calls' arguments to add in the new boolean for the new role.

In `UsageStatisticsAttributes.java`, there is a `valueOf()` method that takes in a `teammates.storage.entity.UsageStatistics` and creates a `UsageStatisticsAttributes` with the same attributes. It's quite similar to what we're trying to do here

I think we can create another `valueOf` (Overloading) for the SQL version of `UsageStatistics`. To resolve the class name conflicts, the new method's parameter type can be `teammates.sqlstorage.entity.UsageStatistics` (No need to import). The old method can remain. 

@InfinityTwo Let me know what you think about this proposal!

hmm im not sure about making these `XXXCanAccess` and `XXXCannotAccess` methods `private`, since I think it's easily possible for actions to specify some odd combo of `XXXCanAccess`, then we would need to change this, which is not really extensible.

also, it's kinda weird that we have a non-private `verifyMaintainerCanAccess` but not for the other users?

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

thanks for this huge refactoring!! 🤩

High-level structural changes:
- Change `private` methods that are possible to be called by test cases to `public`. To avoid duplicate code and extensibility
- For code clarity, we can still preserve the high-level and mid-level groups, as per the old `BaseActionTest`, but within the groups we should maintain order from admin -&gt; maintainer -&gt; instructor -&gt; student -&gt; unregistered -&gt; without login. Let's also add comments saying: we prefer this ordering for new access control methods + we prefer using high-level access control methods over mid-level ones

Nits:
- Pluralization should be standardized (plural for everything, except for AnyXXX)
- Change guest to `WithoutLogin`, since guest can still imply guest account
- verifyInstructorsCanAccess: Should clarify to `verifyAnyInstructorCanAccess`
- `instructorCanAccess`: change to just log in as instructor + can access -&gt; pass!

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

I directly modified the branch, since it's way too much work to do this via reviews..

Big changes made:
- Shifted order of tests to high-level -&gt; mid-level -&gt; helper methods
  - Rationale: From reader's perspective, high-level tests should be the first thing they read, since we prefer for them to use these tests
- Re-classified and re-ordered some tests
- `verifyInstructorsOfTheSameCourseCanAccess`: Removed check that instructors from a different course cannot access
  - Rationale: The method name does not imply this
  - Resulting changes: 
    - Moved logic of private `instructorsOfTheSameCourseCanAccess` into `verifyInstructorsOfTheSameCourseCanAccess`
    - Added check in `verifyOnlyInstructorsOfTheSameCourseCanAccess` that instructors from a different course cannot access
- `verifyInstructorsCanAccess`: Abstracted out logic of `loginAsInstructorOfTheSameCourse`
- `verifyInstructorsCanAccess`: Added additional check that instructors from different course can access as well
  - Note: The 2 checks here are looser versions of `verifyInstructorsOfTheSameCourseCanAccess` and `verifyInstructorsOfOtherCoursesCanAccess`
- `verifyInstructorsOfOtherCoursesCanAccess`: Added 2x `verifyCannotMasquerade` checks, as per old version
  - Requires that `verifyInstructorsOfOtherCoursesCanAccess` takes in argument of `currentCourse`
- `verifyStudentsOfOtherCoursesCannotAccess`: Changed `loginAsStudentOfTheSameCourse` to `loginAsStudentOfOtherCourse`

Nits:
- Renamed `verifyAnyInstructorsCanAccess` to `verifyAnyInstructorCanAccess`
- Renamed `verifyNoOneCanAccess` to `verifyNoUsersCanAccess`
- Renamed `loginStudentsOfSameCourseSetup` to `loginAsStudentOfTheSameCourse`
- Renamed `loginInstructorsOfOtherCourseSetup` to `loginAsInstructorOfOtherCourse`
- Renamed `verifyInstructorsCanAccessNoMasquerade` to `verifyAnyNonMasqueradingInstructorCanAccess`
- Changed comments explaining high-level and mid-level tests + best practices

For all of these test cases with CSRF tokens, let's keep the naming convention consistent with the other test cases (i.e. `test<functionName>_<scenario>_<outcome>`)!

If it's more convenient, I think we can also reuse the old test's method name and compile all the CSRF-related tests in the same method:

```
@Test
void testExecute_addCsrfTokenCookies_shouldAddToResponseAccordingToExistingCsrfToken() ``{``
        ...
        
        ______TS("No logged in user");
        
        ...
``}``

%%[created at: 2025 Mar 24 15:50:33]%%

This code is correct! but I was just initially puzzled by how we can set weight to be `null` when it's of `number` type. Turns out we can.. by doing `const weight: number = null as any;` to bypass the type checking, and i think that's what we're doing here.

I think we should follow TypeScript's type safety as best as we can for both type safety and readability. Thus, I think we need to change the following:

Line 17: `weightPerOption: Record&lt;string, number | null> = ``{````}``;`
Line 18: `weightedPercentagePerOption: Record&lt;string, number | null> = ``{````}``;`
Line 48: `const weight: number | null = this.question.mcqWeights[i];`
Line 57: `const weight: number | null = this.weightPerOption[answer];`
Line 58: Add a null check, similar to what you did here
Line 63: `const weight: number | null = this.weightPerOption[answer];`
... probably many more, please add as you see fit

Sorry this review took so long.. You're PR is on the right track! Some observations:

1. Users cannot give the "other" option an empty weight. System will always change it to 0.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b33cf1-fe29-48f0-9745-bb6fe4ddea9d

2. In the below image, for the column titles for Per Recipient Statistics, let's add a space between the option label and assigned weight for readability. For instance, "option 1 [-]". 

<img width="1198" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-24 at 4 08 05 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/187ee298-d5b2-436c-9b7a-44f8000165ce" />

3. Also would it be possible to add a tooltip icon behind "Per Recipient Statistics" to indicate the format used for "Option 1 [-]"? Similar to this:

<img width="639" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-24 at 4 23 58 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c33e329-70e1-4571-aa4d-f5cf5c0f9e7a" />


3. When I download the results, the display of the null values should be handled too (i.e., display using "-"). You can refer to #12545 and see how I modified `src/web/app/components/question-types/question-statistics/rubric-question-statistics.component.ts` to fix this similar problem

I think the old test case's setup method name needs to be kept as `prepareTestData()`, since it overrides the method in `BaseActionTest`.  perhaps this was a mistake? I think this will fix the failing component test

%%[created at: 2025 Feb 11 14:47:11]%%

## Description

Currently, documentation on testing is spread into many pages, which may lead to confusion for budding developers. 

To summarize the pages that mention testing:
- [Workflow: Development](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#testing)
  - Contains: Overview of testing, Running frontend tests, Running backend tests
- [How-to: Unit Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/unit-testing.html)
  - Contains: What is unit testing, Writing unit tests, Running frontend/backend tests
- [How-to: E2E Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/e2e-testing.html)
  - Contains: What is E2E testing, Running E2E tests, Writing E2E tests
- [How-to: Performance Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/performance-testing.html)
  - Contains: Creating performance tests, Running performance tests
- [How-to: Accessibility Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/axe-testing.html)
  - Contains: What is accessibility testing, Running accessibility tests, Creating accessibility tests
- [How-to: Snapshot Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html)
  - Contains: What is snapshot testing, How does snapshot testing work, How do we use snapshot testing, When to use snapshot testing, Best Practices
- [Best Practices: Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/best-practices/testing.html)

## Potential Areas of Confusion
- Duplicate content: https://teammates.github.io/teammates/unit-testing.html#running-tests and https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#running-tests
- Inconsistent language: It's not really clear what's the difference between component tests and unit tests in TEAMMATES.
- Inconsistent content sequence: Most of the testing pages contain "how to **run** the tests" and "how to **write** the tests". But their order across pages is not consistent.
- In the documentation menu, the navlink for snapshot testing is not grouped together with the navlinks for the other tests. New developers interested in testing may miss out on snapshot testing as a result.

## Suggestions
- The testing section in the [Workflow: Development](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#testing) page should serve as a landing/entry page to all tests in TEAMMATES. The section should only contain links to the individual How-to pages. The hierarchy of tests should be defined clearly here.
- For all of the How-to pages on testing, "how to run the tests" should always precede "how to write the tests", since developers are more likely to run tests before writing any.
- Prefer links over duplicate content

Feel free to add/discuss/clarify the above potential areas of confusion and suggestions!

</div>

%%[created at: 2025 Apr 10 15:26:13]%%

In our [E2E Testing docs](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/e2e-testing.html), the instructions to setup the local testing environment is not clear. 

Some of my personal experiences when setting up E2E include:
- Setting `test.selenium.browser` to the correct browser is not mentioned. "e.g. to configure which browser and test accounts to use." seems to be the only relevant instruction? but that's not really explicit
- "Before running E2E tests, it is important to have the dev server running locally first if you are testing against it.": This line, which is essential to running the E2E tests, is obscurely hidden between FAQ-type notes. Imo, I think this should be part of the essential steps to setting up E2E testing. Also it should be specified that both the frontend and backend dev server need to be running, and that the frontend/backend url in `test.properties` needs to be changed accordingly
- If running FE and BE separately, need to change FE url to `4200`
- Make sure driver path is to the executable, not just the folder containing the executable
- For Mac users, chromedriver may be unidentified software, so need to allow in permissions
- "Using Firefox/Chrome/Edge": Downloading the relevant XXXdriver and specifying the path are essential steps. But these are also mixed with other FAQ-type notes, so new developers may miss out on reading these steps
- The troubleshooting guide answers a bunch of FAQs on E2E tests. I think the E2E testing docs should include a link to the troubleshooting guide

Hi @sonnwell @gustavofda, Thank you for your interest in contributing to TEAMMATES! Currently, we have 3 PRs (#13192, #13183, #13179) that attempt to resolve this issue. We will work on reviewing their solutions first! I recommend looking for other issues to work on in the meantime :)

After further investigation, the `IllegalArgumentException` comes from Line 39 of `AccountRequestSearchManager.java`. 

```
UUID id = UUID.fromString((String) document.getFieldValue("id"));
```

`document.getFieldValue("id")` returns a String like `"instr1@course1.tmt%TEAMMATES Test Institute 1"`, which seems like a concatenation of email and institute. Since it's not a UUID, the above exception will be thrown.

It seems like the SolrDocument ID is a concatenation of email and institute, but the AccountRequest entity ID is a UUID

Something odd I observed is that `SearchAccountRequestsActionTest` only fails when I run it on its own (i.e., `./gradlew unitTests --tests teammates.ui.webapi.SearchAccountRequestsActionTest`)

<img width="1208" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9de97d0-ff38-4f66-8eaa-6d7cf406ca6e" />

When I run all of the backend component tests together (i.e., `./gradlew componentTests --continue`), the test passes:

<img width="1142" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4faf9346-5722-4cf1-b3d8-7de2f8a1f73b" />

This may be related to why the component tests on the GitHub CI pass

Based on the git blame [here](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blame/5c940458d89b615f1c9cbbdae3d86513d99c11bf/src/main/java/teammates/storage/api/FeedbackSessionsDb.java) at line 559 and the discussion on [#6029](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/6029), I believe the `-2` days is for being safe (e.g., different timezones) while achieving the goal of reducing the number of session returned. 

```
// only get sessions with startTime within the past two days to reduce the number of sessions returned
Date d = TimeHelper.getDateOffsetToCurrentTime(-2);
```

But I do understand the confusion that may arise, since the current code does not contain the above comment and does not explain why it's `-2`. Perhaps we can clarify this by adding back the old comment?

`ArchiveCourseAction` depends on `InstructorAttributes::isArchievd`, but new `Instructor` SQL entity does not contain `isArchived` attribute anymore. Thus, not sure if this action will be relevant anymore

Nope! Just confirmed that archive courses feature will be deprecated entirely. Hence the reason why the action was not migrated in SQL. Therefore, the relevant tests are also no longer needed.

Renaming the attributes in the entity code may introduce bugs as the names of these attributes in the backend datastore remain unchanged. If we want to rename the entity attributes we can use the `@AlsoLoad` annotation:

If keeping the DB column names unchanged but changing the name in the entity, you can use

`@Column(nullable = false, name = "&lt;COLUMN_NAME>")`

this way you should be able to keep the new names in the rest of the code & test data files as well

Hello, I generally agree that the new naming convention is clearer and more consistent.

However, I noticed you renamed some of the database columns. Updating the DB schema to rename the columns is quite risky, and is not something we have the capacity to handle at the moment. I suggest leaving the DB schema unchanged while renaming the rest of the code.

Perhaps you can also open a new issue to document the inconsistency in the DB column names specifically, which can be addressed in the future.

Other than that, looks good to me. Thanks for your hard work and attention to detail!

Looks good so far! There's a couple small things not yet covered by this unit test that you may want to add on:

- Test the case where `Logic::getInstructorForEmail` throws `SearchServiceException`
- Check that the returned `JsonResult` message & status code is as expected

Thanks for the fix! Perhaps you can also add a test case to `FeedbackSessionClosingSoonRemindersActionIT` to check for this issue to prevent regression in the future.

I've also encountered this issue – it seems like multiple requests are being made for some reason (but not for every course). I'll investigate it further and see if it can be replicated consistently across different contexts.

May I know what browser you are using when encountering this bug?

I believe it is a client-side issue as it only seems to happen with courses that are already expanded on initial page load (i.e. first 3, sorted by default [creation date]). I think I know where the issue is so I'll submit a PR once I've found & tested a fix

@DhiraPT Do you encounter this bug on local dev server as well, or only on production?

After looking into it a bit more, this bug appears to have been fixed already (#13130), but the fix has not yet been deployed to production. The reason we could not replicate it locally is likely because our local instances used the master branch.

This bug should be fixed on our next release, which we are planning to do once the SQL migration is complete.

Good catch – I suggest adding this issue to the developer documentation (option 1) rather than modifying the docker-compose. Should be a relatively simple addition.

Thanks for raising this issue! I managed to replicate the issue. However, manually clearing the cookies did not resolve the issue for me. I suspect the root cause is the Google login persisting rather than the TEAMMATES cookies – I'll investigate this a bit further to see if this is the case.

Steps to replicate:
1. Log in with a Google account not associated with any TEAMMATES account. This will display the "Ooops!" message.
2. Log out. This will redirect to home page, and it will appear to have logged out (top right will display "Login" instead of the gmail address)
3. Try to log in again.

After investigating this further, it seems like the issue of unexpectedly logging in again occurs when only 1 account is currently signed in to Google. With multiple accounts logged in to Google, trying to log in to TEAMMATES (step 3 above) shows Google's choose account screen. I think this is typical behavior for Firebase authentication.

2 possible solutions:
1. [Force the account picker screen for each login](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62043170/firebase-google-auth-wont-let-me-choose-the-account-to-connect-with), which would make it obvious that the user is signing in again (vs auto account selection making it seem like they never logged out).
2. Edit the message to tell the user to log into Google _separately_ with the correct account before trying to log in to TEAMMATES again.

> in the production app, I can't log in to another account even after logging out. But in dev, it does go to the login page

Yup, I think this is due to how the Google authentication works. I suggested 2 possible solutions above, but will leave the discussion open to decide which option is better.
