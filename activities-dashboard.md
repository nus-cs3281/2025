# GitHub Activities Dashboard

* This page contains a list of your NUS-OSS GitHub posts during the period eligible for course credit.<br>
  For CS3282 students, the activity period varies based on when you finished CS3282.
* The content of each panel body may not be exactly as it shows up on GitHub, as some crude sanitizations have been done to prevent post contents interfering with MarkBind parsing.
* It goes without saying that GitHub activities are not the sole representation of your work. It's just one source of evidence only. So, don't put too much importance on what you see in this page.<br>
  Furthermore, the stats (i.e., posts counts) are not directly comparable between devs, as they are influenced by the type of work/project.
* This page will be updated once in a while, in 1-2 week intervals.
